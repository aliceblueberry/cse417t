[title]EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION: AN ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL YITCHAK HABERFELD Tel Aviv University 
[content]Empirical findings have indicated that gender-based discrimination manifested during the assignment of workers to organizational posi- tions. Since the position occupied has a major effect on a worker's salary, discriminatory processes in assigning positions should be incor- porated into a salary discrimination model. Organizational variables were more important than individual variables in explaining both gitimate salary differentials between the men and women studied gender-based salary discrimination. Numerous studies have concluded that women are discriminated against in the labor market: they receive lower wages than men with skills and attributes. Cain (1986) summarizes these studies, most have split the total, or observed, wage differential between men and into two portions: the "legitimate" portion resulting from differences characteristics known to affect worker's productivity, and the "illegitimate" portion resulting from gender-based wage discrimination. Researchers estimated the effect of the discriminatory component by subtracting legitimate portion from the total observed wage differential. This model, however, is seriously flawed. In estimating the tions, most studies have focused on individual characteristics, such as ed- ucation and labor market experience, while holding constant organizational characteristics that may also determine wages-such as job, hierarchical position, and departmental location-or ignoring them completely. The as- signment of workers to organizational positions, however, may also be sub- ject to discriminatory practices. If that is the case, holding organizational characteristics constant by comparing men and women who hold similar organizational positions cannot allow researchers to capture the wage im- pact of discrimination that occurs when people are assigned to those posi- tions. In other words, conventional models may significantly underestimate the full extent of wage discrimination against women. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK During the last decade, organizational analysis has proved able for revealing dimensions of gender inequality, most notably, I thank Yehouda Shenhav for his help in this study and am also deeply indebted Cohen and Gideon Kunda for their helpful comments. The Sapir Institute for Tel Aviv University provided funds for this research. 161This content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
Academy of Management Journal gation, or the division of jobs into men's and women's categories (e.g., Blau, 1977). Taking into account that men and women work not only in different occupations, but also under different job titles within organizations, Bielby and Baron (1986) demonstrated that the extent of gender-based job segrega- tion in nearly 300 California organizations was much more pervasive than previous research focusing on occupations only had suggested. Furthermore, men and women not only hold different job titles in organizations, but also occupy different hierarchical positions, with men dominating the manage- rial and supervisory ranks and women concentrated in the lower organiza- tional ranks (Wolf & Fligstein, 1979a,b). Yet investigators have rarely taken the implications of such findings for research on gender-based salary differentials into account. To the extent that organizational variables have been included in models of wage discrimina- tion, they have been treated as control variables. Another stream of research was triggered by the "comparable worth" literature. A situation of compa- rable worth occurs when two or more different jobs are equivalent in value to an employer. Advocates of comparable worth argue that in such situations the jobs should be paid equally. Recent work on comparable worth has attempted to study the effects of organizational variables on gender-based employment segregation (e.g., Hartmann, 1987; Roos, 1981) but has not in- tegrated segregation practices and the salary determination process into a single model of employment discrimination. The few studies that have in- cluded organizational variables have treated them as given and labeled as discrimination only that portion of the observed wage gap between men and women not due to their different individual characteristics and organiza- tional positions. For instance, if men and women with equal education, experience, and other relevant individual characteristics hold different jobs within an organization, and as a result receive unequal wages, such studies would conclude that the wage differential between the two groups is the result not of discrimination but rather of their having different job titles. Thus, the wage differences between people holding different organizational positions are linked to the legitimate portion of the wage differential be- tween men ahd women. To be sure, for wage determination the characteristics of an individual's position in an organization are no less important than the person's "human capital" (cf. Baron, 1984: 57-59). Organizational positions in organizations are often determined by a set of bureaucratic rules and not labor market forces of supply and demand. In such organizations, which called "internal labor markets," an employee's job assignment, organization- al tenure, hierarchical level, and organizational location are the direct come of managerial decisions. Job assignments determine wage grade ders and associated working conditions. Organizational location, or position in a unit such as a division or a department, may affect a worker's exposure to organizational rewards and career opportunities. Those who work close a company's headquarters, for example, may enjoy better working condi- tions than those employed in peripheral divisions simply because the former 162 MarchThis content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
have more information regarding organizational policies and better access to rewards and opportunities. Likewise, access to high-level positions is deter- mined by promotion processes, which are probably the major avenue through which organizations affect earnings inequality, since they create formally stratified social structures (Scott, 1987; Simon, 1957). Organiza- tional rank also constitutes a significant resource in the process of accumu- lating power, money, and prestige. The mechanisms by which promotion opportunities are distributed are part of an organization's human resources management practices (Baron, 1984; Granovetter, 1981). Thus, an accurate estimation of wage discrimination must take into account (1) the extent to which the managerial process of assigning people to organizational positions is discriminatory and (2) the effect of such discrim- inatory practices on wages. Regarding the first question, previous research in various organizational settings has suggested that organizational hiring and promotion policies favor men over women (e.g., Baron, 1984; Cannings, 1988; Kanter, 1977).1 Hence, Hypothesis la: Organizations discriminate against women when assigning people to high-level positions. Hypothesis Ib: Unmasking organizational discrimination in assigning positions will increase the proportion of the overall wage gap between men and women accounted for by gender-based wage discrimination. The next question is whether more discrimination is associated with organizational or with individual attributes. The organizational component consists of discrimination occurring when companies assign positions and evaluate them. Such evaluations can result in differential pay for men and women in similar positions. The individual component consists of pay- ing women less than men for individual attributes. There are reasons to believe that discrimination associated with organizational attributes is more prevalent than that associated with individual attributes. Because they face an environment hostile to discrimination, it is increasingly unacceptable for large organizations to pay different wages to men and women holding iden- tical positions, especially if those workers have similar individual charac- teristics. In such cases it would be relatively easy to prove that the organ- izations indeed engaged in discriminatory practices. In contrast, organiza- tional discrimination in assigning positions is more difficult to unmask and challenge. Assigning men and women of similar characteristics to different 1 Research results in this area have been, however, inconclusive. On the one hand, Olson and Becker (1983) suggested that women often must satisfy higher standards than men to gain promotion and Cannings (1988) obtained similar results. On the other hand, several firm-level analyses have found that women enjoyed better promotion opportunities than men (Hartmann, 1987; Lewis, 1986; Stewart & Gudykunst, 1982; Tsui & Gutek, 1984). But when these differences are adjusted for levels of human capital and job characteristics, women lose their promotion advantage.

Academy of Management Journal positions associated with wide wage differentials may play a major role in creating the observed gender-based wage gap. Thus, Hypothesis 2: Organizational variables account for a larger portion of the discriminatory component of the to- tal wage gap between men and women than individual variables. To be sure, the process of assigning men and women to different jobs, ranks, and departments is not completely discriminatory and is legitimate when it stems from differences in relevant individual characteristics. We also know that wages in large organizations, and particularly in those oper- ating as internal labor markets, are determined more by the characteristics a position than by individual characteristics. Hence, the nondiscriminatory dimensions by which workers are assigned to various organizational posi- tions should have a major impact on wages. Hypothesis 3: Organizational variables primarily explain the legitimate portion of the wage gap between men and women. Testing these hypotheses required a model integrating processes into the widely used labor market model of Such a model must not assume that the existing division tions between men and women is a given. Rather, it reveal discriminatory processes that regulate the attainment sitions. However, before I present such a model, a technical conventional labor market model and its shortcomings organizational component of gender-based wage discrimination MODELS OF GENDER-BASED DISCRIMINATION The Conventional Model The conventional wage discrimination model can be given as y = ap + pz + e, (1) where y = wages, p = productivity, a = productivity's coefficient, z = gender, 3 = gender's coefficient, and e = an error term. In this model, wage discrimination against women is present if z is 1 = male, 0 = female, and the gender coefficient is positive, or 164 MarchThis content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
receive an unexplained wage premium over women with productivity dif- ferences controlled. Most researchers engaged in empirical research aimed at estimating gen- der discrimination have in fact studied the following relationship: y = aq + bz + u, (2) where q = estimated productivity, a = estimated productivity's coefficient, b = gender's coefficient, and u = an error term. Since systematic performance scores (p) are generally unobtainable, searchers are forced to use human capital proxies of productivity instead While admittedly crude, this is a well-established practice in sociological and economic research; a replaces a in the empirical investigations, the gender coefficient, provides an estimate of P. The fact that human variables are an imperfect predictor of actual productivity might estimate of salary discrimination (b). However, the direction and magnitude of such bias depend on much that is beyond the scope of this Goldberger (1984) extensively discussed this issue. It should also that wage discrimination studies have generally estimated separate tions for men and women. Appendix A provides the method for estimated salary discrimination when two separate equations are As discussed at the outset of this paper, a major weakness of ventional model is that it compares the wages paid to men and possessing similar attributes and holding similar positions. Since tion of attributes and positions may itself reflect discrimination, them constant (q in Equation 2) may yield biased estimates for crimination. Some economists have noted these biases. Blau and Ferber (1987) example, referred to the possibility that salary discrimination may women's decisions not to acquire salary-related attributes since their returns on such attributes are low. They called such a possibility a "feedback effect" and concluded by stating that "estimation of feedback effects is an extremely important area which has been neglected in previous work" (1987: Bayer and Astin (1975) and Hoffman (1976) were aware of the possibility that rank itself may reflect discrimination and chose to omit rank from group of individual determinants of scientists' salaries. As expected, estimates of salary discrimination against women were larger than obtained with rank included among the salary determinants. Omitting rank might be better than simply controlling for gender differences in rank cause it points at possible discriminatory treatment in promotion. However, omission of salary-related variables results in model misspecification Haberfeld 1992 165This content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
Academy of Management Journal cannot be recommended as a way for solving the problem of controlling variables that contain discrimination. The Organizational Model My proposed model integrates discriminatory processes associated with organizational wage determinants, such as position in an organizational erarchy, into the wage discrimination model. This model has two steps. First, it estimates gender-based discrimination in the acquisition of organ- izational rank: r = C' T + dz + v, (3) where r = organizational rank, T = a vector of rank determinants, C = a vector of their coefficients, d = discriminatory practices against women seeking to enter certain organizational levels, and v = an error term. In terms of my first hypothesis, I expected d to be positive: ceteris men are more likely than women to attain high ranks. In this model's second step, rank (Equation 3) is replaced with indicating expected organizational rank and based on the assumption the process of acquiring organizational rank is free of discrimination. estimated the rank acquisition of men. An estimate of rank acquisition of gender-based discrimination could then be calculated for an ulation by applying the coefficients derived for men to both women. The predicted rank represents the rank of each individual and female employees would have been promoted according to rules-the rules by which men are promoted. y = q* + g (r) + bz + u, (4) where q* = productivity, not including rank, r = predicted rank calculated for each worker coefficients for men, and g = the effect of rank acquired in the absence of discrimination on wages. In terms of the second hypothesis, I expected the wage discrimination esti- mate (b) derived from the new model (Equation 4) to be larger than the estimate derived from the conventional model (Equation 2). Likewise, I ex- pected the new model to enable testing Hypotheses 2 and 3 by comparing the contribution of organizational and individual attributes to b and q*. This can be accomplished by decomposing each one of the wage gaps-legitimate 166 MarchThis content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
and discriminatory-into two portions: one resulted from organizational (internal) factors and the other from individual (external) factors. METHODS Setting and Data Testing the model specified in Equation 4 required detailed individual and organizational characteristics of workers in one or firms. I obtained such data during 1987 from a large Israeli corporation specializing in advanced telecommunication technology and diagnostic tems and encompassing the entire production process-research, ment, planning, and manufacturing. Accordingly, the corporation an extremely heterogeneous work force comprising engineers, professionals, technical workers, clerks, production workers, and support staff. obtained from an Israeli rather than an American firm should not limit the analysis because the processes of gender-based employment discrimination operating in the Israeli labor market are similar to those operating in the United States (Izraeli & Gaier, 1979; Semyonov & Kraus, 1983). The firm operates seven different functional divisions located in the central part of the country. Some 21 percent of its 5,087 employees are women. The head office employs 9 percent of the corporate work force, and half of those people are women. Data were obtained from the organization's personnel files, and records of all workers employed by this corporation were used in the analysis. The corporation studied operates as an internal labor market. Workers are organized into five distinct job clusters (Dunlop, 1957), each a separate domain within which an employee may be upgraded, transferred, or laid-off (Doeringer, 1967). In this firm, 33 percent of the work force is employed in research and engineering jobs, 12 percent in support jobs (e.g., personnel, clerical), 25 percent in technical jobs, 27 percent in production, and 3 per- cent in other professional jobs (e.g., law, accounting). Mobility across clusters is extremely low, partially because the skills and training required in each cluster differ and partially because each has a separate collective contract. All workers in each cluster are represented by union, and most of the bargaining revolves around salaries, benefits, and work rules. Workers are assigned to clusters mainly at the hiring stage, with assignments made according to individuals' qualifications, training, and previous occupations. Each cluster has from 10 to 15 wage grades along which employees progress according to seniority, education, and general performance evalu- ations made by their superiors. In addition, the firm's managerial ladder is open (at least formally) to all employees irrespective of the job cluster which they belong. Promotion to managerial positions is company-wide and does not take place separately within each cluster. As a result, promotions are not subject to the collective bargaining process and are left to managerial discretion. 1992 Haberfeld 167This content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
Academy of Management Journal Thus, workers belonging to different clusters can occupy identical man- agerial levels. The managerial ladder consists of five levels ranging from group head up to division head. All managers are recruited from within the company, and new managers almost invariably begin at the first level. Pro- motion along the hierarchical ladder is based on managerial discretion and on company rules, such as contribution to the firm. The total salary of each employee is thus a function of organizational and individual variables. The main organizational attributes are seniority and the job cluster and hierarchical level in which a worker is situated. The main individual attributes are education and performance, which is mea- sured by general, informal evaluations by superiors.2 The combination of seniority, education, and performance appraisal determines the wage grade within a cluster in which a worker is situated. Thus, employees can obtain pay increases within job clusters and organizational ranks by moving along the wage grades associated with each cluster on the basis of their individual characteristics. Variables Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the variables used in the for all the company's employees and for men and women separately. pendix B gives operational definitions of the variables. The table includes data on the dependent variable, total monthly salary, and on two groups independent variables. The first group comprises individual variables, external labor market variables, including the human capital variables: a proxy for labor market experience; age squared, for detecting change positive relationship between age and salary beyond a certain age; and a of four dummy variables indicating educational level, with the high school level serving as the omitted category to which all the other educational categories are compared. Gender, marital status, and number of children also included in the individual variables. The second group consists of organizational, or internal labor market, variables and includes tenure in the organization, a major determinant rewards in companies operating as internal labor markets; a set of dummy variables indicating five hierarchical levels, with nonmanagers as the omit- ted category to which all the other five categories are compared; a set of dummy variables for organizational divisions, with the headquarters sion as the omitted category; and another set of four dummy variables for clusters: service, clerical and support jobs; research and engineering; tech- 2 This firm did not systematically report performance appraisals. The unavailability performance information could be a major problem in the study of promotion processes small differences in performance may result in significant differences in rank attained. To extent that the portions of performance its proxies do not capture covary with gender, absence of performance ratings could bias the results of this study. However, I have no evidence that such covariance occurs. 168 MarchThis content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms

Academy of Management Journal nical; and production jobs. The omitted job cluster is professional jobs. The first job cluster includes mainly jobs typically filled by women, such as clerical jobs; the second cluster has more "men's" than "women's" jobs, mainly engineering and research jobs; and the other groups are mixed as far as gender-type is concerned. Two final variables are a continuous measure of hierarchical level (rank) and a measure of working hours. Estimation Models Ordinary-least-squares and two-stage least squares regression analyses were used to estimate the various models in this study. For each model, estimated the discrimination level twice, once for all employees, with gen- der included in the equation, and once for men and women separately. I then decomposed the observed gap into an explained portion and an unex- plained, or discriminatory, portion. Three empirical models were estimated, corresponding to Equations 2, 3, and 4. First, I studied a salary model in which the dependent variable exam- ined was monthly salary. One equation included only individual-level terminants, a second only organizational determinants, and the third, both groups of salary determinants (see Equation 2). This was done in order estimate the contribution of within-organization and individual factors both the explained and unexplained portions of the gender-based salary gap as estimated by the conventional model. In the second estimated model, hierarchical rank served as the depen- dent variable. The purpose of this estimation procedure was twofold. First, I tested Hypothesis la to determine the extent of discrimination involved the process of placing employees in managerial positions (Equation 3). ond, I used results obtained with the rank equation for men to calculate predicted rank value for the women employed in the firm. The third model examines the effect of hierarchical level on salary while taking into consideration discriminatory processes affecting promotion high levels (Equation 4) by including the predicted rank value for women. This model allowed tests of Hypotheses lb, 2, and 3. Two explanatory comments are necessary here. First, the equation rank includes all the independent variables presented in the full equation wages, plus a set of dummy variables representing the organizational sions to which employees belong. A division in the corporation under study is practically an "establishment" (Granovetter, 1984), a plant in which ing, promotion, and firing decisions are made autonomously. I included this variable in the rank equation owing to its special importance for the major organizational processes under study, wage determination and motion. The company's divisions not only had different promotion practices but also different sizes. Researchers have found that establishment size is asso- ciated with promotion opportunities (Baron, 1984; Rosenbaum, 1979) and with attributes of organizations and industries (Baron, 1984; Kimberly, 1976; 170 MarchThis content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
Villemez & Bridges, 1988). Moreover, establishment size may mediate the relationship between human capital variables and promotion processes (Stolzenberg, 1978). Salary practices, on the other hand, which are rooted in labor contracts, were hypothesized to be uniform within job clusters and invariant across divisions. Second, attention should be drawn to differences between labor con- tracts in the United States and Israel. Whereas an American contract in a multiplant company is often concluded at a plant level, an Israeli agreement is company-wide and is worked out separately for each job cluster. result, uniform wage agreements are made within job clusters, irrespective organizational divisions. Thus, both the rank and wages equations may seen as estimates of a single model in which rank is estimated initially,organizational divisions serve as instruments in identifying the equation, and the predicted value of an employee's hierarchical level is derived using the rank equation of men for calculating rank of both gender groups. These predicted values replace the actual organizational positions in second step, when a new wages equation is estimated. RESULTS Hypothesis la predicts gender-based discrimination in the determina- tion of rank. Table 2 shows results of the regression analysis testing hypothesis. It reveals a coefficient of 0.3 for gender, representing the tage that men enjoy over women in the attainment of high ranks due the men's individual characteristics but merely to their gender. overall gap in rank between men and women is 0.4 (Table 1), it appears a full three-quarters of the observed gap between the two groups in izational rank is due to discrimination. The remaining hypotheses deal the implications of such organizational discrimination in assignment sitions for wage discrimination. Table 3 summarizes the relevant results the regression analyses presented in Tables 2, 4, and 5. The total wage gap between men and women in the organization is $580.90.4 based on the conventional wage model, which ignores discrimination rank, suggest that 68 percent of this gap is legitimate and 32 percent discriminatory (Appendix A explains how these figures were calculated). contrast, results using the integrated organizational discrimination which takes into account prior discrimination in rank, indicate that cent of the gap is discriminatory and only 64 is legitimate. These 3 To examine whether the use of dummy variables rather than a continuous organization- level variable affected results, I estimated an additional equation for wages, substituting rank variable for the five level variables and estimating separate equations for all workers, and women. The signs, magnitudes, and standard errors of the coefficients in these were almost identical to those presented in Table 4. The difference between the coefficients estimated in the whole-group equations was less than 2 percent. 4 The results of t-tests for differences in means between men's and women's averages dependent variables were significant: for wages, t = 38.7, and for rank, t = 15.0. 1992 Haberfeld 171This content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms

But they also enjoyed higher returns for each additional year of age than the women ($63.81 vs. $48.06), a difference that contributes significantly to the estimated discriminatory wage gap. The difference between the returns obtained by men and women for each year of age could be due to the use of age as a proxy labor market experience. Assuming that women's labor market careers are often interrupted, situation in which men and women enjoy similar returns for each additional year of market experience would be reflected in a lower estimated age coefficient for the women. 7 However, this portion of the gap cannot be attributed to the internal and external variables only, as can the legitimate gap. The discriminatory portion contains a third component, difference in the intercepts of the equations calculated for men and women, which is impossible to attribute to a specific group of variables. 1992 173This content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms

value of discrimination in returns to individual characteristics. This pattern is merely an artifact associated with the conventional model; since discrim- ination in assignment to position is not considered, individual variables- age, in particular-dominate the model and artificially capture the effect of such discriminatory assignments on wages. DISCUSSION The empirical results of the study are unequivocal: integrating izational processes into a wage determination model reveals gender-based discrimination that is higher than that estimated models. Further, organizational rather than individual variables most of both portions of the wage differential-the discriminatory legitimate. These results have a number of implications. First, labor market re- search should not simply control for organizational attributes. Rather, re- searchers should study organizational attributes explicitly, looking for pos- sible discriminatory practices, and incorporate those variables into models dealing with employment discrimination. A necessary condition for such an examination is the availability of detailed organizational data. This study demonstrates some advantages of such an approach and suggests new pos- sibilities for the analysis of firm-level data in the study of discrimination. Second, differential remuneration for men and women who hold different organizational positions or perform different jobs is widely accepted (cf. Treiman & Hartmann, 1981). Proponents of the comparable worth argument should, however, consider the chances of men's and women's entering var- ious jobs if they seek to price the effect of hiring discrimination by estimating its effect on wage differentials between men and women. The same criticism may be leveled at the method of pricing jobs according to the responsibility associated with them, which ignores the barriers faced by women who seek to attain responsible positions. Investigators using a conventional model for detecting salary discrimination will identify only employers who pay dif- ferent salaries to equally situated workers. They are thus in effect searching for signs of overt discrimination-employers with a smoking gun in hand. The integrated organizational model of salary discrimination proposed here is a means of identifying covert discriminatory practices. When estimates of the effects of such practices are added to those of practices that are clearly defined as discriminatory, the overall estimate of salary discrimination in- creases. Two caveats are in order. First, on the basis of Shenhav, 1991), I assumed that men and women are equally into managerial positions. Furthermore, both the conventional ganizational models of salary discrimination are based that all salary-related variables are incorporated in result, the illegitimate portion of the salary gap can residual remaining after subtracting the legitimate portion 1992 Haberfeld 177This content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:10:12 UTCAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
Academy of Management Journal between men and women. However, it is possible that such assumptions are false and that women are less motivated than men to become managers, or that unmeasured variables are related to both salary and gender; for instance, men might show more job commitment than women. If this is the case, the results presented above could be biased. Second, inability to generalize conclusions to large segments of the la- bor force is inherent in a firm-level research design. This and other limita- tions discussed previously should be kept in mind when considering this study's results and conclusions. On the other hand, there is no research strategy better suited to investigating the critical contribution of work organ- izations to market discrimination. The proposed research strategy and em- ployment discrimination model may be applied to any organization. The results presented here merely demonstrate the advantages to be gained from such an approach. Future research in this area should focus on two major issues. First, the organizational model of discrimination presented here should be applied to additional organizational processes, such as the assignment of workers to jobs, departments, and divisions and the process of hiring. For example, the percentage of women in this company's work force (21 percent) is approx- imately half the percentage of women in the national Israeli labor market. This might be an indication of gender-based access discrimination in the studied firm. Incorporating the hiring process into the organizational model of discrimination studied here might have yielded an even larger estimate of salary discrimination against women in the company. Second, this model should be studied in various types of organizations in order to identify structural influences on its effectiveness. It is possible that the policies, structure, culture, and goals of the organization studied affected this study's results. Similar studies in other organizations will enable isolation of the variance in discrimination resulting from interorganizational characteristics. REFERENCES Baron, J. N. 1984.

APPENDIX A In wage discrimination studies, wage equations are estimated separately for women as follows: Ym =bom + BmXm and Yw = bow + Bw Xw, where y denotes salary, bo is an intercept, B is a coefficients vector, X is a vector of determinants, and "m" and "w" denote men and women. The observed salary differential - Yw) is decomposed (Iams and Thornton, 1975, and Oaxaca, 1973, explain this method) (1) a legitimate portion attributable to differing levels of such salary determinants as different human capital levels or differing jobs: Bm (Xm - _X), (2) a portion attributable to differing coefficients, or returns on the salary determinants: X' (Bm - Bw), and (3) a shift coefficient - bow), which is the difference between the constant terms of the two equations. Discrimina- tion (D) is estimated by the sum of the shift coefficient and the differences between the ficients: D = (bom - bow) + Xw (Bm - Bw).
