 Abstract The concept of "glass ceiling effects" has emerged in social science research
 in general and higher education in particular over the past 20 years. These studies have
 described the impediments that women and people of color encounter in their quest for
 senior-level positions (e.g., CEOs) in society as glass ceiling effects. Literature, both
 empirical and non-empirical, has provided broad and varied interpretations of glass ceiling
 effects. In turn, the literature is less-than-settled on the application of glass ceiling effects.
 In this manuscript, the authors analyzed and critiqued 66 documents in order to advance
 theoretical and practical knowledge regarding glass ceiling effects in higher education.
 Keywords Glass ceiling ? Diversity ? Discrimination ? Gender inequities ?
 Racial disparities
 The concept of the "glass ceiling" has become increasingly embedded in the discourse
 and praxis of society (Coleman 1998). The core principles of a glass ceiling align with
 a contemporary movement to diversify senior-level positions in society by making
 advancements with regards to gender and racial/ethnic participation. Specifically, the
 concept of a glass ceiling is generally viewed as a set of impediments and/or barriers to
 career advancement for women and people of color (Baxter and Wright 2000; Morrison
 et al. 1987; Morrison and Von Glinow 1990). These impediments and/or barriers span a
 constellation of variables that materialize into conscious and sub-conscious discrimi?
 natory practices (Lee 2002; Martin 1991, 1992; Padavic and Reskin 2002; Ridge way
 2001). As such, this manuscript is focused on the myriad effects of the glass ceiling
 phenomena. It is precisely this issue?the multiplicity of effects?that underscores the
 rationale for the current literature review. Therefore, the animating intent of this
 manuscript is to synthesize "what we know about glass ceiling effects" research in

 order to advance the use of the concept to encourage higher education research on the
 topic.
 Approximately 20 years have passed since the Federal Government has dedicated
 resources to addressing a probable glass ceiling in the United States workforce (Martin
 1991; Martin 1992). These initial efforts were primarily concerned with inequities in
 management positions within the corporate sector. Most importantly, these initiatives
 brought national attention to the hiring practices that resulted in the composition of the
 workforce, and in turn, served as a clarion call for researchers to examine gender and race/
 ethnicity related issues in the workplace (Federal Glass Ceiling Commission 1995a, b).
 Interestingly enough, demographic trends show that the United States workforce is shifting
 to include more women than men, and slow steady growth for people of color (Toossi
 2005). While these data are revealing of advancements for both women and people of
 color in the U.S. workforce, these trends are not reflected in senior-level positions in
 higher education (Athey et al. 2000; Burbridge 1994; Johnsrud and Heck 1994). It should
 also be noted that for women and people of color who do achieve these senior-level
 positions, they are disproportionately located in 2-year colleges and less prestigious 4-year
 institutions.
 Likewise, diversity among students and faculty are not reflective of demographic
 shifts in society. For example, in 2006, women constituted 23% of all college presi?
 dencies (King and Gomez 2007), while female faculty comprised 53% of all faculty in
 2005 (National Center for Education Statistics 2008), and female students accounted for
 over half (approximately 57%) of all college matriculants in 2005 (NCES 2008). People
 of color held 13.6% of college presidencies in 2006 (King and Gomez 2007), while
 according to the National Center for Education Statistics (2008) faculty of color com?
 prised approximately 16% in 2005 and students of color comprised 31% of the total
 student body.
 Despite these aforementioned trends and the national attention to glass ceiling effects,
 the related theoretical and empirical body of work is sporadic. One major reason for this
 occurrence is that existing research is not largely concentrated in one academic field, but
 rather across several. In turn, these inquiries are not consistent or comprehensive and do
 little to build a well defined understanding of a glass ceiling or its accompanying effects.
 Accordingly, it is timely to synthesize the social science literature to glean the collective
 knowledge from previous research. In light of the charge of the Glass Ceiling Commission
 and the need to crystallize knowledge to inform practice, this project is an attempt to
 review and synthesize existing scholarly research and discourse. In turn, the research
 questions for this manuscript are: (a) how much research on glass ceiling effects has been
 done since the formation of glass ceiling commission?; (b) what trends are evident across
 this body of research?; (c) what research questions have been addressed?; (d) what research
 topics have been emphasized? (e) what frameworks were used to guide studies?; (f) what
 research methods were employed?; and (g) what has been learned about glass ceiling
 effects?
 To organize this review, we first provide a historical understanding of how the glass
 ceiling emerged as a concern in the United States. Next, we detail the review methods that
 describe how we managed the document search and analyzed the sample of documents.
 The next section presents the results of the review. The first section of the results details a
 taxonomy of the sample of documents. The second section presents a critical analysis of
 these documents. The concluding sections present implications of the review for future
 research, practice, and policy development.

 The Emergence of Glass Ceiling Effects as a National Concern
 History of the Concept
 While undoubtedly used prior to the 1980s by feminists and those watchful of sexism in the
 workplace, the term "glass ceiling" was quickly incorporated into the lexicon of high-level
 female business leaders in corporate America after appearing in an article from the Wall
 Street Journal (Hymowitz and Schellhardt 1986). While the term was first coined to
 describe the experiences of women in corporate America, since the 1980s the Federal
 Government has recognized the existence of a glass ceiling which prohibited the
 advancement of women and people of color, among other disenfranchised groups, in the
 workplace. It is generally believed that it was not until this time period, and the involvement
 of the federal government, that the glass ceiling descriptor was applied to the discriminatory
 experiences of people of color. In 1987 the Department of Labor published a report
 Workforce 2000 which brought widespread attention to the composition of the U.S.
 workforce, including the increased importance of men and women of all races as major
 contributors to the American economy. To investigate and remedy exposed inequities in the
 workplace, a bipartisan Federal Glass Ceiling Commission was created through Title II of
 the Civil Rights Act of 1991 [See Glazer-Raymo (1999) for more information on the history
 of the term and it's applicability to higher education].
 Initially, the commission (chaired by the Secretary of Labor) was charged with con?
 ducting a study of opportunities and artificial barriers to the advancement of women and
 people of color into management and decision-making positions in corporate America.
 Concurrently, they were charged with preparing written reports based on the findings of
 this study. Four major publications were issued by the commission: (a) A Report on the
 Glass Ceiling Commission; (b) Pipelines of Progress?A Status Report on the Glass
 Ceiling; (c) Good for Business: Making Full Use of the Nation's Human Capital; and (d) A
 Solid Investment: Making Full Use of the Nation's Human Capital were published between
 1992 and 1995. Each report consistently described and documented the existence of a glass
 ceiling for women and people of color in the United States labor force. The commission
 recognized the glass ceiling as an invisible barrier that confronts women and people of
 color as they approach the top of the corporate hierarchy. As the Federal Glass Ceiling
 Commission was focused on business leaders and capital ventures in the U.S. economy, the
 existence of glass ceiling effects in other sectors of the economy was not explored.
 The U.S. Department of Labor reports that from 1979 to 2002, the proportion of women
 employed as managers, administrators, or executives nearly doubled and their earnings
 grew by 27% (Chao and Utgoff 2004). More specifically, women's participation in the
 category of managerial or professional specialty occupations grew from 22% in 1983 to
 34% in 2002. However, the report makes special mention that these jobs remained highly
 segregated by traditional occupational standards with women predominantly in service
 sector and care-taking occupations. The report also indicates that White women were more
 likely than women of color to work in managerial or professional specialty occupations.
 Thirty-five percent of White women, 26% of Black women, and 19% of Hispanic women
 held positions as managers, administrators, or executives (Chao and Utgoff 2004).
 The Federal Glass Ceiling Commission described three classes of barriers for women
 and people of color in top level management. Societal Barriers describe the availability
 and quantity of educated women and people of color for particular positions and the
 differences that can be attributed to different groups of individuals as they relate to desired
 leadership characteristics. The second class of barriers are Internal Structural Barriers.

 These barriers include a lack of outreach efforts on behalf of businesses to underrepre
 sented populations, corporate climates that may not be tolerant of difference, and pipeline
 barriers which include a resistance to training and mentoring members of underrepresented
 groups for future promotions. The third class of barriers are described as Government
 Barriers. These barriers include a lack of monitoring and law enforcement on behalf of the
 government, weaknesses in data collection for descriptive analyses, and discussion and
 inadequate reporting on the existence of a glass ceiling.
 The federal government has also tracked the progress of women and people of color in
 business. According to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) statistics, the
 number of women, Blacks, and Hispanics in management has quadrupled and the number
 of Asians has increased eightfold (Morrison and Von Glinow 1990). However, regardless
 of the successes reported by private research firms and industry studies, scholars (e.g.,
 Ohlott et al. 1994; Maume 2004) still cite the glass ceiling as a reality facing business?
 women in the senior-level management positions. These trends hold true for people of
 color as well.
 Perspectives on Glass Ceiling Effects
 Previous research has documented the interplay between gender, race/ethnicity, and the
 glass ceiling in business and management organizations noting challenges and successes
 for women and people of color in senior-levels positions (Bartol et al. 2003; Morrison and
 Von Glinow 1990; Powell and Butterfield 1994). Relying on previous research in orga?
 nizational management theory, two theories have attempted to explain glass ceilings in
 organizational contexts. First, institutional theories emphasize restrictive rules which
 maintain organizational stability over time (DiMaggio and Powell 1991; Frankforter 1996).
 Stability, typically buffered by policies and management hierarchies, can be seen as bar?
 riers to mobility for women and people of color by maintaining the organizational status
 quo wherein the cultural majority remains in positions of power and dominance. It may be
 argued that it is these same factors that perpetuate the glass ceiling. Second, social theories
 rely on cultural biases which define leadership and competence as masculine character?
 istics (Frankforter 1996; Powell 1988; Cox 1994). The implication is that women or people
 of color who do not model their leadership behavior after traditional White male styles of
 management will not be as successful or recognized for their effectiveness in the work?
 place (Frankforter 1996). Further complicating this issue is other studies (e.g., Bartol et al.
 2003) which have concluded that in patriarchal organizations men view their perspectives
 and norms as being representative of gender-neutral organizational structures and assume
 the structure is asexual.
 Researchers (e.g., Frankforter 1996; Morrison and Von Glinow 1990) have expanded on
 the social theory above to include a discussion of three major reasons for discriminatory
 practices, based on gender and race/ethnicity, in organizational contexts. First, a deficiency
 theory has been proposed that describes women and people of color as lacking qualities
 necessary for leadership (Morrison and Von Glinow 1990; Riger and Galligan 1980).
 These perceived deficiencies are the reason that they are treated differently by the majority.
 Second, overt discrimination by the majority culture is used to explain differential treat?
 ment (Morrison and Von Glinow 1990; Powell 1988). Lastly, structural theories describe
 systemic discrimination in which organizational policies and practices disproportionately
 and negatively impact women and people of color. These practices effectively create a
 "hidden" system of discrimination (Kanter 1977; Morrison and Von Glinow 1990; Riger
 and Galligan 1980), often called a "glass ceiling." However, it must be noted that there are

 various other colorful terms used to describe the embedded, structural discrimination of
 women and people of color in organizations. These include the "concrete ceiling" (Ogilvie
 and Jones 1996), "sticky floor" (Padavic and Reskin 2002; Tesch et al. 1995) and "glass
 door" (Cohen et al. 1998). In addition, although not the focus of this current review, is the
 notion of tokenism, which has also been used to explain the rare presence of women and
 people of color in senior-level management positions. By holding a select group of indi?
 viduals up as representatives, or tokens, of their gender or racial/ethnic group,
 organizations are able to present an atmosphere of fair hiring practices and equal oppor?
 tunities (Cox 1990; Frankforter 1996; Kanter 1977). Nonetheless, the main focus of this
 review is to describe how, to-date, the concept of the glass ceiling has been understood and
 deployed in scholarly research.
 The Glass Ceiling in Higher Education
 Similarly, the glass ceiling in higher education has been explored using various method?
 ologies (Glazer-Raymo 1999). Some studies focus on the proportional representation of
 women and people of color and use demographic information to provide data that shows
 the dismal representation for these groups in senior-level positions (Corrigan 2002; Hill
 2004), while other studies focus on employment trends for women and administrators of
 color in colleges and universities (Harvey 1991; Johnsrud 1991; Johnsrud and Heck 1994).
 For example, the positions they held and the types of institutions where they are employed
 are provided as evidence to demonstrate that women and people of color are not equal in
 terms of their professional standing compared to White males (e.g., levels of power,
 decision-making, and authority) in educational institutions (Ards et al. 1997; Fisher et al.
 1993; Harvey 1991; Johnsrud 1991; Johnsrud and Heck 1994). Policy-oriented approaches
 to addressing equity in the workforce examine how specific higher education organizations
 have successfully or unsuccessfully increased the representation of women and people of
 color on college campuses (Sagaria 1988). Researchers have also identified a "double
 whammy" for African-American women in higher education leadership positions. This
 term describes the reality that African-American women belong to two groups which face
 discrimination: women and people of color (Chliwniak 1997).
 In relation to leadership within higher education, The American College President
 Report issued by the American Council on Education (ACE) reveals that while women
 hold 40% of all faculty and senior staff, only 21.1% of all college presidents are women.
 Additionally, 84% of presidents, 83% of business officers, and 75% of academic deans are
 male at colleges and universities (Corrigan 2002). Women in Higher Education also cites
 American Council on Education statistics which report on the racial diversity of women
 CEOs on college campuses.1 Nine percent of CEOs on college campuses are African
 American, 2% are American Indian, 0.1% are Asian American, 5% are Hispanic, and 84%
 are White. Interestingly, a higher proportion of presidents of color are women compared to
 White presidents. Thirty-five percent of Hispanic presidents are women and 24% of
 African-American presidents are women, compared to 21% of White presidents. These
 data support the reality that people of color are underrepresented in leadership positions at
 colleges and universities as compared to national population-trend data, while simulta?
 neously suggesting that there is a unique relationship between gender and race for people
 of color.

 Administrative salary data from ACE also reveals that women consistently lag behind
 men regarding compensation in senior-level administrative positions at all types of insti?
 tutions. Bradburn et al. (2002) describes the salary gap that exists between male and female
 faculty. In 1998, full-time male faculty earned about $13,000 more than their female
 colleagues. Bradburn et al. (2002) also reported that female faculty were less likely to work
 at public doctoral, research, and medical institutions, hold full professorships, achieve
 tenure and hold doctoral or other terminal degrees than their male counterparts. Regarding
 race and ethnicity, Bradburn et al. (2002) reported some provocative findings. Asian/
 Pacific Islander faculty had higher average salaries, were more likely to hold advanced
 degrees, and had higher representation at public doctoral, research, and medical institutions
 as compared to White faculty. In contrast, African American faculty were found to have
 lower average salaries, were less likely to hold advanced degrees, or achieve full professor
 status or tenure than White faculty.
 The ACE data suggest that as the number of colleges and universities increased from
 1986 to 2001, so did the percentage of women presidents (Corrigan 2002). The percentage
 of women presidents doubled from 9.6% in 1985 to 21% in 2001, indicating that women
 are beginning to take a larger share of the existing leadership roles on college campuses
 (Corrigan 2002). The increase in representation of women as administrative and profes?
 sional staff members in higher education has heightened the awareness of gender and has
 become a source of recent scholarship (Harvey 1999; Johnsrud and Heck 1994; Sagaria and
 Johnsrud 1991). However, other researchers (e.g., Cox and Nkomo 1990; Lindsay 1999;
 Opp and Gosetti 2002) have commented on the dearth of research focusing on women and
 administrators of color aside from national reports and specialized academic journals
 dedicated to particular ethnic groups. To be sure, the issue of whether there has been
 adequate study of the experiences of women and people of color in leadership positions in
 higher education is unsettled. In summary, the effects of the glass ceiling in higher edu?
 cation may be summarized as: (a) disproportionate representation; (b) disparities in
 compensation, rank, and position; and (c) implementation of support efforts. Other effects
 will be discussed in greater detail in the findings section.
 Method
 This manuscript reviews literature published on glass ceiling effects and provides a
 description of the nature and frequency of this research. In conducting this review, our
 intent was to provide a comprehensive view of this research, rather than a detailed account
 of specific findings. In line with the work on integrative reviews, this review provides
 "enriching perspectives on meanings and circumstances" that seek to, "break down
 boundaries, and cause things (or thinking) to expand" (Eisenhart 1998, p. 394). In order to
 provide a comprehensive review of the frameworks, methods, and findings from each of
 the 66 documents, this manuscript aggregates salient information from the 66 documents to
 create new knowledge. For example, this review takes a well-documented concept, the
 "glass ceiling" and seeks to enrich our scholarly understanding of the term by analyzing
 the historical context, the contemporaneous uses of the term, and the ways in which this
 term has infiltrated research literature. By comparing and contrasting the work from
 multiple areas,2 (all grounded in the belief that they are discussing glass ceiling effects), we
 2 We would like to note that the comparison is not to suggest that conceptual and epistemological dif?
 ferences do not exist across fields and disciplines, but rather we want to identify unifying macro themes.

 hope to aid in building a scholarly consensus on what a glass ceiling is and how it operates.
 Alternatively, it must be acknowledged that this outcome may not materialize, but a
 realization that no consensus on what a glass ceiling is exist. This current analysis of
 research also provides space for the discussion of policy implications and future research.
 As the intent is not to provide a detailed review of each research study, a description of the
 studies from this manuscript may be found elsewhere (see Jackson and O'Callaghan 2007).
 Search Procedures
 There were only 66 documents that met the criteria for inclusion at the time of this review.
 A three stage process resulted in this sample for review. First, six electronic databases were
 used to conduct searches: (a) ERIC database; (b) Proquest; (c) RDS Contemporary
 Women's Issues; (d) Academic Search/EBSCO; (e) HW Wilson (Education full-text); and
 (f) JSTOR. These databases were searched using the following terms: (a) glass ceiling and
 (b) glass ceiling ejfect(s). The search included all published documents available through
 2004. Our comprehensive search yielded 270 results. Second, abstracts were printed and
 screened by the researchers using the required inclusion criteria (i.e., document used glass
 ceiling to describe some form of workplace discrimination). At this stage, we were only
 concerned with documents that actually used the term glass ceiling. We did not use
 documents that did not attribute a glass ceiling to the form of discrimination studied. More
 specifically, manuscripts that did not include the phrase, "glass ceiling," but may be
 investigating or discussing gender or racial inequity in its various forms, were not included.
 The abstracts that were deemed appropriate were identified, and the full articles were read
 for potential inclusion. One-hundred and fifty-nine documents were read, and studies that
 did not meet the aforementioned standard for inclusion were removed. Third, to make
 certain all appropriate documents were included in this analysis, 20 experts from multiple
 research fields and/or disciplines who had published widely on related topics were con?
 sulted. These experts were sent the comprehensive list of documents and were asked to
 identify others that may have been omitted. The diverse group of experts ranged from
 policy experts, to senior-level administrators, to professors from various fields including
 business management, sociology, psychology and higher education. The experts suggested
 three publications which were ultimately included in the review. This search process
 resulted in a total of 66 usable documents for this analysis (see Appendix Table 1).
 Analysis Procedures
 The documents were analyzed in three phases. First, we conducted preliminary sorting of these
 articles in three fields and/or disciplines of study: (a) business; (b) education; and (c) social
 sciences. Next, we analyzed the documents by empirical versus non-empirical, purpose, scope,
 theoretical framework, workforce sector, level of position, type of diversity, research design,
 implications, and type of glass ceiling effect. In doing so, intentional efforts were made to
 uncover specific implications and outcomes from each document. In addition, special efforts
 were made to synthesize any uniform strengths or weaknesses/criticisms for these documents.
 The analysis procedures were managed using traditional approaches for empirical reviews
 (Galvan 2004; Miles and Huberman 1994). We based the synthesis of literature in our man?
 uscript on an informal process of grouping works according to an artificial, though grounded,
 taxonomy that we see as key descriptors to organize and understand the literature (Strauss and
 Corbin 1990). Dividing the research in this way provides a heuristic to illuminate potential
 problems and opportunities for researchers in higher education.

 Findings
 The findings section is organized into two stages: (a) taxonomy of documents; and (b)
 critical review of documents. The first stage provides a descriptive categorization of
 documents according to the domains used to classify them. The second stage provides a
 critical analysis of documents based on the strengths and weaknesses of empirical and
 theoretical contributions.
 Taxonomy of Documents
 Each of the documents were reviewed and classified into domains: empirical versus non
 empirical, purpose of study, work force sector, level of position, type of diversity, method
 of study, definition of glass ceiling, scope of study, theoretical framework, implications,
 and types of glass ceiling effects. These domains were selected because they form the basic
 criteria generally used to evaluate appropriate manuscript development and to evaluate the
 quality of research. Regarding empirical focus, the sample of documents was 45%
 empirical and 55% non-empirical. In the context of this manuscript, empirical documents
 report original data and analysis, and documents that presented theoretical-based argu?
 ments without the use of original data were classified as non-empirical. The purpose of
 study for these documents spanned across a breadth of topics within various employment
 industries (see Jackson and O'Callaghan 2007).
 Documents analyzed for this study examined topics associated with three specific fields
 and/or disciplines of study: (a) business; (b) education; and (c) social sciences. The
 majority of these documents focused on business constituting 43.1% of the sample, fol?
 lowed by 32.3% in education, and 24.6% in the social sciences. Topics within these
 domains covered various areas including: college and university faculty, government
 officials, business managers, and the United States armed forces. As for the level of
 positions studied, approximately 7.3% focused on mid-level positions, 21.8% on senior
 level positions, 9.1% on mixed levels, and 61.8% focused on promotional studies.3 Some
 of the specific positions studied included: business owners, college presidents, college
 faculty, and captains in the Air force. For the most part, these documents focused on glass
 ceiling effects concerning diversity on two levels: gender and race/ethnicity. In turn,
 approximately 56.5% focused on gender, 3.2% on race/ethnicity, and 40.3% included both
 gender and race/ethnicity.
 In an attempt to understand glass ceiling effects, authors of these documents employed
 either quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods. That is, 81.8% of these documents used
 quantitative methods, 9.1% used qualitative methods, and 9.1% used mixed methods. A
 closer examination of these documents show the following as some of the methods used:
 ANOVA, ethnographic interviews, Chi-square, path analysis, hierarchical regression,
 logistic regression, Oaxaca decomposition, and OLS regression.
 Curiously, in these documents focused on glass ceiling effects, only 73.8% provided an
 operational definition of the glass ceiling, while the remainder did not (26.2%) (see
 Appendix Table 2). Of the documents providing definitions, 47.9% attributed their oper?
 ational definition to other authors. The vast majority of these studies (73.9%) relied on one
 particular definition, provided by Morrison and Von Glinow (1990). The remaining 52.1%
 3 In the context of this manuscript, promotional studies refer to those which analyze promotion patterns in
 particular organizations or follow individual cohorts as they ascend the employment hierarchy to increasing
 levels of responsibility, visibility, and power.

 of these studies which provided definitions relied on their own, self-authored definition of a
 glass ceiling. Over half of the definitions provided by the studies utilized the words
 "barrier" or "obstacle" to describe a glass ceiling. Another 16.6% of the studies only used
 the words "glass ceiling" in their title or in the text as an impact term and did not provide a
 definition of the term. Of additional interest is that while the U. S. Government officially
 recognized a glass ceiling for women and people of color, only 33.3% of the definitions
 explicitly defined the glass ceiling in relation to race or ethnicity (i.e., included the words
 race, ethnicity, minority, or person of color in the definition).
 In delineating the documents by scope of study, the majority of them utilized national
 datasets. Specifically, 9.1% examined a state system or international/national firm, 20.5%
 examined a single institution or firm, 6.8% used a random sample, 22.7% used a purposeful
 sample, 6.8% used a national random sample, and 34.1% used a national dataset. The vast
 majority of empirical studies were either focused on one educational institution or orga?
 nization, or they relied on previously collected data to support their study.
 Of the documents on glass ceiling effects, only 38.5% provided an explicit theoretical
 framework, while 61.4% did not. Of the frameworks noted, no two were the same. The
 scope of frameworks used in these studies are vast and contains theoretical underpinnings
 from economics, sociology, business administration, and psychological fields and/or dis?
 ciplines. The variable "glass ceiling effects exist" was used to determine whether the
 analyzed documents clearly stated that a glass ceiling was evident operating to limit
 the opportunities of women and people of color. Approximately three-quarters (72.3%) of
 the documents concluded that glass ceiling effects exist, 23.1% concluded that glass ceiling
 effects did not exist, and 4.6% were inconclusive. The studies which were inconclusive did
 not state that glass ceiling effects exists, rather they noted support for the idea that barriers
 and obstacles exists for women and people of color.
 Critical Review of Research
 The critical review of these documents brings attention to the following areas of interests:
 (a) purpose of study; (b) subjects under review; (c) frameworks employed; (d) conclusions
 about glass ceiling effects; and (e) suggestions for remedies to the glass ceiling. The
 documents were analyzed in their respective fields and/or disciplines of study, but were
 compared and contrasted with respect to the aforementioned categories with studies from
 across the different fields and disciplines. The general strengths and weaknesses of the
 studies from each sector are discussed.
 Education
 The empirical studies in this area focused on researching and analyzing gender and race in
 higher education from a multitude of perspectives (Ards et al. 1997; Johnsrud 1991;
 Johnsrud and Heck 1994; Kahn 1993; Lee 2002; Tesch et al. 1995), including promotion
 (Bain and Cummings 2000; Ginther and Hayes 1999; Johnsrud 1991; Johnsrud and Heck
 1994; Shultz et al. 1992) and salary studies (Fisher et al. 1993; Ginther and Hayes 1999;
 Johnsrud 1991; Johnsrud and Heck 1994). The focus of the studies ranged from faculty in
 wide-ranging disciplines (Ards et al. 1997; Fisher et al. 1993; Ginther and Hayes 1999;
 Kahn 1993; Tesch et al. 1995; Shultz et al. 1992; Tesch and Nattinger 1997) to admin?
 istrators (Johnsrud 1991; Johnsrud and Heck 1994). In contrast, the non-empirical studies
 focused on the individual experiences of women and people of color in the academy (e.g.,
 Chesterman et al. 2003; Harvey 1999), reviewing the literature on the representation of

 women and people of color in academy (e.g., Chliwniak 1997; Glazer-Raymo 1999;
 Hagedorn and Laden 2002) and the role of mentoring in the advancement of women and
 people of color (Luna and Gullen 1995; Scanlon 1997).
 Over half of the empirical studies focused on glass ceiling issues in a single institution
 (Johnsrud 1991; Johnsrud and Heck 1994; Shultz et al. 1992), while others relied on
 nationally representative data sets such as the Carnegie Foundation International Survey of
 the Academic Profession (Bain and Cummings 2000), the National Science Foundation
 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (Ginther and Hayes 1999; Kahn 1993), and the National
 Study of Postsecondary Faculty (Lee 2002) or samples gathered from national organiza?
 tions such as the American Business Law Association (Fisher et al. 1993), and the
 Association of American Medical Colleges (Tesch et al. 1995).
 The frameworks employed by the researchers in the education discipline are disparate;
 however, two studies rely on the concept of barriers to guide their inquiry (Coleman 1998;
 Bain and Cummings 2000). Some of the other frameworks identified include: gender
 stratification (Johnsrud 1991), homosocial reproduction (Johnsrud and Heck 1994), labor
 market rationales (Lee 2002), and racism (Lee 2002). The majority of the studies from this
 sector did not explicitly identify a guiding framework.
 Collectively, the results from these studies support multiple, and at times contradictory
 conclusions about how a glass ceiling operates in education. Regardless of the explanations
 provided for why glass ceilings exist, this group is the most cohesive in its support of the
 existence of a glass ceiling. Only two studies contained mixed results in regards to whether
 a glass ceiling exists (i.e., Hagedorn and Laden 2002; Lee 2002). The remaining studies
 supported the existence of the glass ceiling, but in various forms and for various reasons.
 The findings from these studies, or alternatively their unique conception of a glass ceiling,
 includes the following: (a) that race is the most significant explanation for persistent
 differences in rank among faculty (Ards et al. 1997); (b) that differences in rank are largely
 to blame for the difference in salaries between male and female faculty (Ginther and Hayes
 1999); (c) that the brevity of careers for female faculty causes inequalities (Bain and
 Cummings 2000); and (d) that pay differences between male and females are due to the
 number of years worked in the academy, not gender bias (Fisher et al. 1993). However,
 other studies (e.g., Ginther and Hayes 1999; Tesch et al. 1995) conclude that even after
 taking productivity, demographic characteristics, primary work activity, and differential
 attrition rates into account, substantial gender differences in promotion still exist. In
 particular, one study focused on female faculty documented that women, entering the job
 market directly after obtaining a Ph.D., are less likely to enter tenure-track faculty jobs and
 subsequently have a harder time and take longer to achieve tenure once they are in a
 tenure-track position (Kahn 1993).
 The notion that the effect of gender bias is cumulative has gained empirical support
 (Johnsrud and Heck 1994). More specifically, the negative effects on career prospects,
 stemming from being female, increase over the course of a career. That is, the effects of
 gender stratification are additive in nature and disproportionately affect women the longer
 they persist in their careers. In other words, glass ceiling effects operates throughout a
 woman's career, and may get worse as her career grows. In regards to institutional support
 for females in their attempts to "break through" the glass ceiling, researchers have noted
 that women felt more personal obstacles and less institutional support in achieving their
 goals than their male peers (Shultz et al. 1992). In addition, research has documented that
 people of color have reported similar experiences (Morrison and Von Glinow 1990; Powell
 and Butterfleld 1997). Some proposed solutions to alleviate the effects of a glass ceiling
 include more institutional support of women and people of color. These institutional

 supports may take the form of a formal acknowledgement of a problem (Hill 2004), the
 establishment and support of mentoring programs (Luna and Cullen 1995; Scanlon 1997),
 increasing the representation of women on campus in senior positions (Chesterman et al.
 2003; Corrigan 2002), and encouraging changes to institutional culture to be more
 accepting of women and people of color (Bain and Cummings 2000).
 Business and Government
 The documents from business and government covered broad topics such as how orga?
 nizational characteristics/management (e.g., promotion structures) and personal attributes
 (e.g., gender and race) intersect to disadvantage particular individuals, resulting in glass
 ceiling effects. The empirical studies focused specifically on the effects of race (Powell and
 Butterfield 1997), gender (Baldwin 1996a; Powell and Butterfield 1994; Cohen et al. 1998;
 Davies-Netzley 1998; Ohlott et al. 1994; Powell and Butterfield 1997; Van Vianen and
 Fisher 2002) and the intersection of both race and gender (Athey et al. 2000; Bartol et al.
 1981; Jacobs 1992; Landau 1995; Maume 2004). The number of studies from the business
 sector which focused on both race and gender is greater than that of the education sector.
 The focus of these studies include salary and wage differentials, (Yamagata et al. 1997),
 the effects of diversity (gender and racial/ethnic) on organizational management, and
 promotion policies and mobility (Athey et al. 2000; Cohen et al. 1998; Landau 1995;
 Powell and Butterfield 1994, 1997). For example, one study examined the effects of
 re-organization efforts on diversity and whether they corresponded to real changes in
 power, control, and authority (as manifested by salary), or whether they simply reflected an
 appreciation for diversity without a simultaneous commitment ensuring diversity existed
 (Jacobs 1992).
 The non-empirical and supporting documents for this sector include numerous literature
 reviews (Bell et al. 2002; Burbridge 1994; Cleveland et al. 2000; Inman 1998; Morrison
 and Von Glinow 1990; Weiler and Bernasek 2001), reports describing the work of the
 Department of Labor Glass Ceiling Initiative (Martin 1991, 1992), and government reports
 from the Federal Glass Ceiling Commission (Federal Glass Ceiling Commission 1995a, b).
 The populations of interest in this category include the military (Bartol et al. 1981;
 Cohen et al. 1998) and female transport workers (Simpson and Holley 2001). Individuals at
 the 'management' level were analyzed in numerous studies (Bartol et al. 1981; Cohen et al.
 1998; Davies-Netzley 1998; Jacobs 1992; Landau 1995; Ohlott et al. 1994; Van Vianen
 and Fisher 2002) and the workforce of the U.S. Federal Government was investigated in
 others (Powell and Butterfield 1994, 1997; Yamagata et al. 1997). The samples for the
 studies utilizing 'management' positions were drawn from the banking industry (Cohen
 et al. 1998) and multinational fortune 500 and fortune-100 companies (Landau 1995;
 Morrison et al. 1987).
 The frameworks from this area of study include the role of optimal bias theory and type
 based mentoring (Athey et al. 2000), person-organizational fit theories (Van Vianen and
 Fisher 2002), institutional sexism and discrimination (Baldwin 1996b; Cohen et al. 1998;
 Jacobs 1992; Morrison and Von Glinow 1990; Powell and Butterfield 1994), disparate
 impact theory (Baldwin 1996a), human capital theory (Baldwin 1996b), managerial
 leadership behavior theory (Bartol et al. 1981), critical mass theory (Jacobs 1992), triple
 jeopardy effect (Landau 1995), the Brunswick lens model (Powell and Butterfield 2002),
 occupational captivitiy theory (Yamagata et al. 1997), neoclassical economics (Weiler and
 Bernasek 2001) and glass ceiling effects (Maume 2004). As demonstrated by this vast list,

 this sector shows the most variability with regards to theoretical approaches to studying the
 glass ceiling.
 The results from this category indicate that while men and women may be present at
 similar organizational levels, women are not given the same amount of responsibility or
 supervisory tasks as males (Ohlott et al. 1994). The notion that a glass ceiling is a unique
 form of gender and racial bias against women and people of color, and that this bias is
 more severe at later stages of career development than at labor market entry was also
 affirmed (Maume 2004). However, a small number of the studies did not provide direct
 evidence of glass ceiling effects. These studies instead focused on other types of inequality,
 that mimicked a glass ceiling, yet presented real barriers for women and people of color
 nonetheless (Jacobs 1992; Powell and Butterfield 1994). For example, one study cited a
 "glass door" which must first be opened by a few women to allow others to pass through in
 the future (Cohen et al. 1998).
 Some suggestions for minimizing glass ceiling effects from this body of research
 include supporting affirmative action programs and policies (Athey et al. 2000), making
 provisions for management training for women (Bartol et al. 1981) and supporting a
 critical mass of women at particular management levels to increase the likelihood of future
 promotions of women to those levels (Cohen et al. 1998). Still another study stated that
 uniform promotion and advancement policies and a strong "promote from within" orga?
 nizational culture will help to remove persistent gender bias (Powell and Butterfield 1994).
 Social Sciences
 The vast majority of studies from this sector focuses only on gender, with a couple taking
 both race/ethnicity and gender into account for their analyses (Cotter et al. 1999, 2001). In
 addition, the goals and purposes of this group of studies are quite divergent. Some studies
 focused on promotions and organizational characteristics (Baxter and Wright 2000;
 Frankforter 1996; McDowell et al. 1999) while other focused on earnings (Cotter et al.
 1999, 2001; Morgan 1998). Additionally, Cotter et al. (2001) provided a comprehensive
 operational definition of the glass ceiling. Specifically, this means a description of the
 conditions necessary for a gender bias or difference to be termed a "glass ceiling effect."
 To date, the most concrete, systemic investigation into the existence of glass ceiling
 effects was conducted by Cotter et al. (2001). In addition, this study holds promise for
 extending a particular line of inquiry as it relates to the glass ceiling. In particular, this
 study should be highlighted as it lends guidance for further, systematic research on glass
 ceiling effects. For example, Maume (2004) adopted Cotter et al.'s (2001) methodology
 and applied it to a longitudinal study of women and African-American managers. The
 findings from this study indicate support for Cotter et al.'s claim that the glass ceiling is a
 unique and identifiable form of discrimination. The test developed by Cotter et al. (2001) is
 based on the premise that the glass ceiling is a specific type of gender or racial inequity that
 should be distinguished from other types of general discrimination. A glass ceiling exists
 when the following four criteria are met: (a) a gender or racial difference that is not
 explained by other job-relevant characteristics of the employee; (b) a gender or racial
 difference that is greater at higher levels of an outcome than at lower levels of an outcome;
 (c) a gender or racial inequality in the chances of advancement into higher levels, not
 merely the proportion of each gender or race currently at those higher levels; and (d) a
 gender or racial inequality that increases over the course of a career.
 The non-empirical research from this sector includes supporting articles which focused
 on the role of stereotypes and beliefs (Chaffins et al. 1995; Ridgeway 2001), salary

 differences (Kay and Hagan 1995), and the stratification of women in the workforce (Kay
 and Hagan 1995; Reskin 1988; Lemons 2003) and the resulting connections to a glass
 ceiling. A sizable number of these articles were primarily literature or research reviews
 (e.g., Chaffins et al. 1995; Chernesky 2003; Powell 1999; Reskin 1998; Ridgeway 2001;
 Padavic and Reskin 2002).
 The data samples and theoretical frameworks for the empirical studies from the social
 sciences sector came from a variety of sources. These include data sets previously used in
 earlier research (Baxter and Wright 2000), unique combinations of existing data sets
 (Cotter et al. 1999), the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (Cotter et al. 2001), a random
 selection of corporations from the U.S. stock exchanges (Frankforter 1996), trade asso?
 ciations for American economists (McDowell et al. 1999), and surveys of social scientists
 and engineers (Morgan 1998). The frameworks utilized by the studies from this sector
 encompass scholarly traditions from a variety of disciplines. These include feminism,
 postmodernism and social constructivism (Buzzanell 1995), human capital theory, labor
 segmentation and Marxist analysis (Reskin 1988; Kay and Hagan 1995), gender schema
 theory (Lemons 2003), and expectation states theory (Ridgeway 2001).
 Taken as a group, this set of studies exhibits the least amount of coherence in regards to
 sample and methods. There is also little agreement within this sector as to whether a glass
 ceiling effect exists. One-third of the studies found that while gender disparities do exist in
 relation to position attainment and promotion, these are attributable to differences other
 than gender (i.e., 'cohort effect' noted by Morgan 1998). In addition, for those studies
 which do cite evidence of a glass ceiling effects, little advice and few suggestions are
 offered for how to remedy the observed gender disparities.
 Conclusion
 The research questions guiding this inquiry were numerous and are re-visited here. That is,
 the aims of the current research were to understand: (a) how much research on glass ceiling
 effects has been done since the formation of glass ceiling commission?; (b) what trends are
 evident across this body of research?; (c) what research questions have been addressed?;
 (d) what research topics have been emphasized? (e) what frameworks were used to guide
 studies?; (f) what research methods were employed?; and (g) what has been learned about
 glass ceiling effects? To answer these research questions, we gathered a large amount of
 data in the form of previously published empirical and non-empirical research about glass
 ceiling effects. From the body of work reviewed, we determined that while there are a large
 number of sources which cite, discuss, and generally acknowledge a glass ceiling, there is
 relatively little empirical research devoted specifically to identifying and investigating
 glass ceiling effects. Our sampling of research questions also uncovered the fact that there
 is little coherence on how glass ceiling effects are identified and studied. However, it
 should be noted that this body of research does emphasize traditional measures of com?
 pensation (e.g., salary) and employment status (e.g., promotion rates) in the discussion of
 glass ceiling effects. The current research also employed various frameworks to guide
 these studies. In fact, the diversity among frameworks was so great, we could find only a
 few studies which were conducted with similar theoretical perspectives. The research
 methods employed by the studies also varied greatly. These included methods from both
 the quantitative and qualitative traditions, as well as from theoretical and non-empirical
 perspectives. In sum, we acknowledge that a great deal has been learned about glass ceiling
 effects in society from this body of work. However, there is little coherence on how best to

 operationalize or measure glass ceiling effects and there is little agreement on the causes or
 origins for women and people of color (see Appendix Table 3 for a summary of the major
 conclusions from the review).
 Implications for Higher Education Research
 Over the last two decades researchers (e.g., Bain and Cummings 2000; Glazer-Raymo
 1999; Reskin and Roos 1990) have expressed dismay that higher education is not more
 receptive to females and people of color rising in senior administrative roles as compared
 to other sectors of our economy, and unfortunately the reality is that women and people of
 color are still denied an equal share of the leadership positions in colleges and universities
 (Bain and Cummings 2000). Resulting from a review of the literature on glass ceiling
 effects in business, education, and social sciences, the following five observations
 emerged. While they are observations of the state of the literature in general, specific issues
 relating to higher education are highlighted. First, while the glass ceiling seems to be a
 common term in conversational discourse, little research has presented clear guidance for
 research and practice-based discourse. For example, there is little agreement on how to
 operationalize a single definition of a glass ceiling so that its effects may be studied in a
 uniform way. The exception to this statement is the study by Cotter et al. (2001) which
 outlines four explicit criteria that must be met to establish that a glass ceiling exists. This
 unfortunate fact also makes cross-sector comparisons difficult.
 Second, empirical studies differed in populations, methodologies, and frameworks to
 such a degree that meaningful comparisons are difficult to assert, even within sectors. For
 example, within higher education a few studies focused on samples within a single
 institution (Johnsrud 1991; Johnsrud and Heck 1994; Shultz et al. 1992), while others
 utilized national data sets (Bain and Cummings 2000; Fisher et al. 1993; Ginther and
 Hayes 1999; Kahn 1993; Lee 2002; Tesch et al. 1995). The ability to make results gen
 eralizable from this group of studies is not readily apparent. In addition, the studies from
 higher education stem from different methodological approaches and frameworks, with the
 majority of them not identifying a dominant framework.
 Next, there is a dearth of scholarship which aims to disentangle the ways that race/
 ethnicity and gender influence glass ceiling effects. Across all sectors, studies typically
 focused on gender, or the combined identities, or sources of discrimination, of race/
 ethnicity and gender. Very few studies focused solely on the effects of race/ethnicity and
 the glass ceiling. This finding is both troubling and surprising given institutions' of higher
 education commitment to racial/ethnicity equity on its campuses and the fact that the
 Department of Labor has explicitly identified the glass ceiling as a barrier for people of
 color. Some notable exceptions to this fact, across both empirical and conceptual schol?
 arship are Ards et al. (1997); Hill (2004); Lee (2002); Powell and Butterfield (1997), all of
 whom primarily take race/ethnicity into account for their analyses.
 Fourth, studies of the glass ceiling in higher education tend to utilize individual career
 histories, case studies, and individual career outcomes as the preferred methodological
 approach. There is a dearth of research focused on national employment trends for the
 academic workforce in general and senior-level administrators in particular. Two guiding
 studies for higher education scholarship are Cotter et al. (2001) and Maume (2004), both of
 which provide an explicit road map for scholars to follow during an investigation of glass
 ceiling effects. While the importance of qualitative research traditions is not minimized by

 this observation, quantitative research methodologies have the ability to enhance and
 amplify the personal voices from individual stories of experiences with glass ceilings.
 Lastly, research on the academic workforce in colleges and universities could benefit
 from a critical review of the research on organizational behavior in the business sector.
 National trend statistics seem to indicate that women are gaining representation in senior
 level management and leadership positions in business at rates which exceed those in
 academia (Center for Women's Business Research 2004; Morrison and Von Glinow 1990).
 It would move the scholarly field further to uncover the reasons why this is the case and
 apply new, innovative solutions to the higher education workforce. These solutions may
 come in the form of organizational and workplace re-structuring or shifting of responsi?
 bilities to ensure a more equitable workforce overall.

 Note: In the context of this manuscript, empirical studies are those specifically designed to measure a glass
 ceiling effect. Non-empirical, or supportive, documents include articles, books, book chapters and reports
 that contribute to the scholarly understanding of glass ceilings, but are not designed to explicitly measure for
 a glass ceiling
 * Original means that the definition of a glass ceiling which appeared in the document was written by the
 author of the document and no reference to an external source was present

 Table 3 Summary table of major conclusions
 Summary of major conclusions
 Research question Conclusion Evidence
 How much research on glass
 ceiling effects has been done
 since the formation of glass
 ceiling commission?
 What trends are evident across this
 body of research?
 A robust body of research has
 emerged.
 What research questions have
 been addressed?
 Multiple studies investigate the
 effects of a glass ceiling. Few
 studies attempt to empirically
 quantify or measure a glass
 ceiling. Additionally, there is
 little coherence in regards to
 how glass ceiling effects are
 identified and studied.
 Multiple and varied.
 What research topics have been
 emphasized?
 Multiple and varied.
 What frameworks were used to
 guide studies?
 Multiple and varied.
 Sixty-five documents were
 identified for review by this
 study.
 Seventy-three percent of reviewed
 documents provided an
 operational definition of the
 glass ceiling. Of the documents
 providing definitions,
 approximately half attributed
 their operational definition of a
 glass ceiling to other authors.
 The majority of documents
 analyze the effects of a glass
 ceiling, rather than identifying
 or quantifying a glass ceiling.
 Studies typically looked at the
 differential impact of sexism
 and discrimination rather than
 investigating how a glass
 ceiling develops and is
 perpetuated.
 Documents analyzed for this study
 examined topics associated with
 three specific fields of study: (a)
 business; (b) education; and (c)
 social sciences. Topics within
 these domains covered various
 areas including: college and
 university faculty, government
 officials, business managers,
 and the United States armed
 forces.
 Of the documents on glass ceiling
 effects, only 38.5% provided an
 explicit theoretical framework,
 while 61.4% did not. Of the
 frameworks noted, no two were
 the same. The scope of
 frameworks used in these
 studies are vast and contains
 theoretical underpinnings from
 economics, sociology, business
 administration, and
 psychological disciplines.

 Table 3 continued
 Summary of major conclusions
 Research question Conclusion Evidence
 What research
 methods were
 employed?
 What has been
 learned about
 glass ceiling
 effects?
 Multiple and varied, including studies
 from both empirical and non-empirical
 traditions.
 A great deal has been written about the
 effects of a glass ceiling, however little
 research has been dedicated to
 identifying and quantifying the
 existence of a glass ceiling.
 Approximately 81.8% of these documents
 used quantitative methods, 9.1% used
 qualitative methods, and 9.1% used
 mixed methods. A closer examination
 of these documents show the following
 as some of the methods used: ANOVA,
 ethnographic interviews, Chi-square,
 path analysis, hierarchical regression,
 logistic regression, Oaxaca
 decomposition, and OLS regression.
 The term "glass ceiling" is common in
 conversational discourse, however,
 there is little agreement on how to
 operationalize a single definition of a
 glass ceiling so that its effects may be
 studied in a uniform way.
