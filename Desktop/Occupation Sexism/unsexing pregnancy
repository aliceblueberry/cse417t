Because sex does not dictate the capacityto provide care in the
home or work inthe market, sex-equality law combatsharmfulsexste-
reotypesbyeliminatingstatutesand regulations that assign these roles
on the basis of sex. Whenit comes to pregnancy, though,courtsand
commentatorsalike chart a very different course.Theyassume that
pregnancy isabiological eventthat is almost exclusively forwomen.
Thus, equal protectionjurisprudenceaccepts thelegal assignmentof
carework duringpregnancy towomen, anda range oflaws regulating
pregnancy carework—fromprenatalleaveunder the Family and
Medical Leave Act to health benefits under theAffordableCare Act to
employment protectionsunderthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act—

standsinstarkcontrast to the unsexedlawofparenting, the sexedpreg-
nancy hasavoided challenge and largely escaped notice.
This Article makes visible thelaw of thesexedpregnancy, identifies
and evaluates the core tension it generates in the lawofsexequality,
andconsiders howtounravelthis tension. Of course,typically only
women can physically carryachild,and therefore somepregnancy regulations
areappropriatelysexspecific. But thenine months of pregnancyencompassa

nothing to do with the physical fact of pregnancy. Expectant fathers

law’s failure to doso marks women for caregiving and men for
breadwinninginthesameproblematic way that sex-equality law has
tried to combat after a child is born. Andwhile pregnancy implicates
real concernsaboutawoman’s constitutionalright to bodily autonomy,
this concern alone cannot justifythe failure to scrutinizeallsex-based
pregnancy regulations, because much prebirth careworkdoesnot involve
the woman’s body atall. After surfacing thelaw’s anomalous sexed
treatment of pregnancy, this Article considershow to harmonizethelaw
of sex equality. This effort can advancenotonly the goal of equality
betweenthe sexes, but alsoequality for lesbian, gay, and transgender
parents, while at the sametimeenhancingwomen’s autonomy.

the sexedpregnancy—asthisArticle does—challenges the verypremise
of these debates.
This Articlerendersthe law ofthe sexed pregnancyvisible, surfaces
a central tension inthe law of sex equalitythatitgenerates, and consid-
ers howtounravelthisdoctrinaltension.Disaggregatingsexfromcareworkatthebeginningis
importantbecause sex-based caregiving
stereotypes—andthesex-discriminatory laws thatenforcethem—areat
the rootof so much sex inequality.11 Dismantling these sexstereotypes
afterbirthis too littlebecauseitis too late.Sticky behaviors marking
womenas caregiversandmenasproviders emerge during thepregnancy
and are difficult to reverse afterbirth. We will never fullyunsex parenting
as longaspregnancy is sexed.
The sexed pregnancy isakeyroadblockinthepathnotonly to
equality between men andwomen but also toequalityforgay,lesbian,
and transgender expectant parents.Alegal systemthatenforces sex-
based caregivingrolescan exclude gay, lesbian,andtransgender
expectant parentsfromitsprotectionssimply becauseoftheir sex and
also reinforcesexstereotypes that are especially difficult fornontradi-
tional families. ThisArticle emphasizestheinterlocking sexstereotypes
of women’s and men’s respective rolesin the familyandatwork that fuel
gendered distributionsofcaregiving.But,indoingso,theArticlealso
highlightsthedamaging consequencesofthe sexed pregnancy forother
familyconfigurations.Forthis reason, whenrelevant,the Article refers to
the nonpregnantexpectantparent insex-neutralterms, ratherthanto
the expectant father.
Constitutionalconcernsrelatedto women’s bodily autonomy that
arise uniquely during pregnancyarecritical considerations, buttheycan-
not justify thelaw’s wholly distinct treatmentof pre- and postbirth carework.Precedentslike Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.
Casey do recognize a problemofconstitutionalmagnitudewithpaternal
involvementinpregnancywhenit amounts to undueintrusiononthe
mother’s body.12 But theverycircumstance thatpermits sex tobe

Casey raised.Oncewe recognize that fathers candoprebirthcarework
without involvingthemother’sbody,theobjection from reproductive
rightsdissipates—although admittedlyitdoesnot disappear.
The rootsofunraveling this keytensioninthelawofsexequalitylie
in theverycasesthathaveconstructedthis tensioninthefirstplace.Sev-
eral SupremeCourtcasesthat serve asthefoundationofthesexed preg-
nancy need notbe overruled butsimply revisited.The SupremeCourt,in
its landmark Geduldig v. Aiello decision, determined that thepregnancy
classificationinthatcase was notsex discriminationsubject to height-
ened scrutiny undertheFourteenthAmendment.13 The Courtalsosug-
gested, however,thatundertherightcircumstances,pregnancydis-
crimination could be thetypeof sex discriminationthattheEqual
Protection Clause scrutinizes and rejects.14 This Article arguesthatmany
of the sexed pregnancy regulationsidentified here areprecisely thetype
of pregnancy regulationsthatwarrantheightened scrutinyandthat
couldwitherunderitsexacting gaze.
Althoughcourts maystrikedown sex-basedpregnancyregulations,
thisArticle considerswhetherthe remedy shouldbeto“levelup”by
extending some existinglawstononpregnant expectant parents when
physical sexdifferencesdonotjustify their exclusion.15 Many pregnancy
protections and benefits can be extended toandutilizedbythoseother
than the pregnantwomanandwithoutmeaningfullyinvolvingher.16
Extending these protectionsandbenefits notonlybolsters sex equality
but canalsoenhance—ratherthan infringe on—women’s constitutionally
guaranteedautonomy. As feministscholarshavearticulated,autonomy
for caregiverscancome from support rather than separateness—andthis
is precisely what extending pregnancy protections and benefits can help
to achieve.17

I. UNSEXING PARENTING
Sex-equality law inthe UnitedStates hasfocusedonwhatthisArticle
callsunsexing. The idea is a simple one: Ifitis not necessarythatsex
determine one’scapacity because of arealdifference between the sexes,
thensexshould not be made todetermineone’scapacity by theforceof
law.18 In suchcircumstances, sex can and should be “disaggregated”from
capacity.19 Otherwise, the law creates a self-reinforcing set of sex roles
based onstereotypes,andsexwillunnecessarily and unfairly limitone’s
station in life.20
Oneofthemostimportantrealms the law has unsexed is carework
withinthe family.Prescribing sex roles in the familygenerates sex
inequalitythat extends farbeyond it, especiallyintotheworkplace.21 The
SupremeCourthasrecognizedthe importantrolethelawhas playedin
allocating “family duties”onthebasisofsex.22 Applyingheightenedscrutiny
under the FourteenthAmendment, theSupremeCourthasheld
both (1)thatthere is nonecessarylinkbetween the abilityto perform
these carework duties andthe sex ofthe parent, and(2) that lawsrelying
on such a linkreinforce sex stereotypes thatlimit both women’s roles at

onlyremoving sex-basedbarrierscreated by legislationthroughthe
application of heightenedscrutinybut also enactinglegislation to create
a world where thesesex-basedlimits would no longer apply.24
This Part begins bydiscussingwhyweunsexcarework (that is,the
theoryofunsexingcarework) andthenturns to explaininghow we unsex
postbirth carework(that is, the doctrineof unsexingcarework).
A. Why We Unsex Parenting
The lawdidnotalwaysunsexparenting.FormostofAmericanhis-
tory, thelife and lawof the sexes were of separate spheres.25 Carework
was presumed to be both aggregated with and distributed by sex. Under
this view,asJusticeGinsburghasexplained,“Itwasman’s lot, becauseof
his nature, to be breadwinner,head of household,representativeofthe
family outside the home; anditwas woman’s lot, becauseofhernature,
not onlytobear, but alsotoraisechildren, and keepthe home in
order.”26 This breadwinner–homemakerdichotomy served asthefounda-
tion for many Supreme Court decisionsupholdinglawsthat distinguished
roles—especiallywork andfamilyroles—onthe basis of sex.27 Because
such lawsweresubjectonlytorationalbasisreview,therewas no need to
show thatmenandwomen wereactuallydifferent to justify treating them
differently.TheCourtupheldsuch laws onthebasisof “opinion”28 or

“widespreadbelief”29 that there is“awidedifferenceinthe respective
spheresanddestiniesof man andwoman.”30
The Court’s rejectionof separate spheres through the application of
heightened scrutinywas founded on the coreequalityprincipleofthe
Equal ProtectionClause: Treat likes alike.31 Thebig leapforwardwas
appreciating that menandwomenweremorealikethanhadpreviously
been thoughtwhenitcomestothecarework involvedinparenting.32
This progress turnedonthejudicial recognitionoftworelatedprinciples:(1)that muchof the work of parenting was notbiologicallyor

elements, such asplanningmeals, making appointments, and keeping

All of this carework thatwentintomaintaining“thedomestic

of womanhood.”41 The Court onlylatercametoappreciate that men and
women coulddothiswork equally. Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, described by
JusticeGinsburgasthe“mostcritical”ofthesexdiscriminationcases
decided by the Courtin the 1970s,42 made clearthat careworkshould be
unsexed because there was no reason that only women could fulfill the
domestictasksjust described.43 Weinberger involved aprovisionofthe

same benefitsuponthedeathof a wifeonlyto her minor childrenand
not her surviving husband.44
In acasedecided afewyears before Weinberger, theCourthad
explainedtheneedforheightenedscrutinyof sex classifications by
disaggregatingsexfrom social role:“[T]he sexcharacteristicfrequently
bearsno relation toability toperformorcontributetosociety.”45 In a
unanimousdecision in Weinberger, the Court appliedthis reasoningto
carework.46 The purposeofthe rule under questionwas“to permit
womento electnotto work and todevotethemselvestothe careof
children”followingthedeathoftheirhusbands.47 The Courtrecognized
that men andwomen were similarly situatedintheirabilitytocarefor
theirchildrenandthat the longstandingpresumptionotherwisewasnot
based onanynecessity.48 Notably,itdid so in thecontextof a motherwho
had died in childbirth,49 therefore recognizing thatfromthemoment of
birth fathers are just as capable parents as mothers.
As forthesecondprinciple, constitutionallawcametorecognizethat
assigningcaregiving rolesbased on sexisnot onlyunnecessarybutactu-
allyharmful.Theharms of treating similarlysituatedmothers and fathers
differently, as the SocialSecurityAct provision discussedin Weinberger
did, flow from“a much broaderpattern of sex-roleenforcementthat
associate[s]menwiththemarketplace andwomenwiththehome.”50
Legislating on the basisofsexstereotypesis so problematic becauseit
renders these stereotypesself-reinforcing,andnowhereisthistruerthan
in thefamily. As Justice Ginsburg has explained,sexclassifications
“enshriningandpromotingthewoman’s ‘natural’roleashomemaker,
and correspondinglyemphasizingthe man’s role as provider,...
impededbothmenandwomen frompursuitof the veryopportunities
thatwould have enabled them tobreakawayfromfamiliarstereotypes.”51

In Nevada DepartmentofHumanResources v. Hibbs, for example,the
Court identifiedmanylawsfeaturingsex-basedclassificationspremised
on thebreadwinner–homemakerdichotomythathadpushedwomen
away from work and intothe home.52 State laws,for instance,hadprohib-
ited womenfromworking as lawyers53 or bartenders,54 or from working
morethan a certain numberofhoursper week.55 By barringwomen
fromenteringcertain professions orlimitingthetermsonwhichthey
couldwork, these lawsnotonly reflected and reinforced stereotypesthat
women’s rolewasathomebut also madeitfar morelikelythatthiswas
so. Therefore,“the primary responsibilityforfamilycaretaking often falls
on women,and such responsibilityaffects theworking lives of women
more thanitaffects theworkinglivesofmen.”56 In fact,Congresshas
traced women’s limitedworkopportunities directly to“thepervasive
presumptionthatwomenaremothersfirst,and workers second,”which
has ledto “discriminationagainst women when they aremothersor
mothers-to-be”57 and left women with lowerpay, less job security, shorter
job tenure, and fewer accumulated benefits.58
Circumscribingmen’s rolesthrough overbroad sex classifications
also causes harm.59 By “presumingalackofdomestic responsibilitiesfor
men,” thesetypesofsexclassifications notonlypigeonholewomeninto
domestic rolesbutalsopushmen away fromthoserolesandintothe
workplace.60 As the Supreme Court recentlystated in Sessions v. Morales-
Santana, “[S]uchlawsmaydisservemenwho exercise responsibility for
raisingtheirchildren.”61 Stereotypingmenas breadwinners harms
women, too,bypushing them still furtherinto family rolesandaway

In United States v. Virginia, theCourtconsidered a challengetothemale-
only admissionspolicy at the VirginiaMilitary Institute(VMI), a state-run
military academy requiring“[p]hysicalrigor”thatmenon averagecould
more readily achievethanwomen on average.74 The Supreme Court
recognized that physical sex differences could in theory justifylimiting
admissions to men but would notdosoinrealityunlessnowomen were
capableoftranscending them.75 Because some womencouldpass VMI’s

constitutional.76
Under thisdoctrineofconstitutional sex-equality law, parentinghas
beenrecognizedasperhapsthemostcritical areato scrutinizebecause
“the faultlinebetween work andfamily” is“precisely where sex-based

DepartmentofHuman Resources v. Hibbs.82 The Courtdecidedthatthere
are nodifferencesbetweenfathersandmothers thatwouldjustifygrant-

“periodof physicaldisabilityduetopregnancy and childbirth.”83 Any
more extendedmaternityleavewas “not attributable toanydifferential

A critical recent pillar in thelaw’s unsexingofpostbirthparenting
has beenrecognizingtherighttosame-sexmarriage.85 Even while the
Constitution policedlawsenforcing sex rolesinthefamily, sex-basedpar-

recognitionofa federal righttosame-sexmarriage rejected the notion
thattherewasanything necessaryabouthavingoneparent of each sex.87
The Supreme Court’s recognition that two men or two women can be
just asgoodparentsas a man and a woman meansthat sex hasbeenstill

responsibilitieslead to discrimination, against either women or men.91
And when formal equalityunderthesestatutes proved too anemicto
unsex attheintersectionofworkandfamily,Congressacted by taking
steps—albeitsmall ones—in passing theFMLA.92 As the SupremeCourt
explained,the FMLA, “[b]y setting a minimum standardoffamilyleave

state-sanctionedstereotype thatonlywomen are responsibleforfamily

This Partfirst explains why we sex pregnancy, unpacking therelevant

jurisprudence typically does not see the carework that transpiresduring

A. Why We Sex Pregnancy
After birth,theconstitutional basis for disaggregating sex from
parenting is the recognition ofvarious “familyduties”that need not be
and thusshouldnot be allocatedon the basisof sex.102 During the nine
months of pregnancy, there are substantialanalogous“familyduties”that
havenothing todowithgestation and thuscanalsobedisaggregated
from sex.103 But unlikethepostbirthperiod,thisprebirthcarework has

capital,whicharediscussed in turn.108
First, expectantparents invest in physical capital in ways thatcanbe
unsexed. Justlike being a parent requires acquiring many goods thatare
neededtocare forthechild,preparingtoparent requiresacquiring
many goodsthatare needed eitherduringthepregnancy orafter
birth.109 Some oftheseproducts will be used exclusively by thepregnant

eitherexpectantparent duringthepregnancy, such as the GettingReady
for Baby book mentionedabove.And still otherproducts canbeused by
either expectant parent after thechildisborn111 but aresubstantially
more useful if purchasedduringthepregnancy. Statelaws require that
expectantparentsmust have a carseatbeforetheydepartfrom a hospital
in avehicle withtheirnewborn.112 The early daysofanewborn involve
hundreds of diapers and little timeto purchase them.113 Only aboutone

meaning that expectantparents usuallyneeda bassinet or crib.114
Regardlessofwhichparent willuse theseproducts, anyexpectantparent
can researchtheproductsand acquire them.
Second, expectantparents invest in humancapital in ways thatcanbe
unsexed. Parents learn howtoassemble toys,respond totheunique emo-
tionalcompositionof a child,andcomplete tasks moreefficientlydueto
the timeconstraintsof parenthood. Likewise,thepregnancy is a ninemonth
periodtoacquire the motivation and knowledgethatwillimprove
one’s performanceas a parent.115 The Supreme Court hasnotedthe
importanceofthenine-month periodforgenerating one’s identityasa
future parent,116 and researchhasfound that developing thiscapacityto
carecan occur regardless of sex.117
Consider,also,theexampleof attending a newborn-careclass.

characterizationofpregnancy, arguing that mencouldbecomparedto
pregnantwomenonly“for other physical or mentalreasons.”129 The par-
ties disagreedaboutwhetheritisunconstitutional sex discriminationto
single outaphysical experiencethatisnecessarilysexed—pregnancy—
foruniquetreatment. But theirdisagreement wasgroundedin a critical
premiseonwhichboth sides agreed:Pregnancy is a necessarily sexed
experience unique to women.TheCourtin Geduldig embraced thisfram-
ingofpregnancy asnecessarilysexed, describing pregnancy as “an objec-
tivelyidentifiablephysical condition with uniquecharacteristics.”130 So
neithertheparties nor the Court recognizedthe nonbiologicalcarework
that pregnancygenerates.131
Even when the Courthasrecognized the social impact ofpregnancy,
it hasstillviewedthissocialimpactasflowing only fromthephysical
experience ofbeingpregnant and thusnot involvingthetype of
careworkthat can bedisaggregatedfromsex. For example,across many
areasoflaw, the SupremeCourthas referredtoemotionalbondingthat
transpires duringthepregnancy, but it has assumedthatthisemotional
bondinghappensonlyas a result of the experience of gestation and is
thus experienced by the mother alone.132 The Courthasnever
recognized any forms of careworkdone during thepregnancythatwould
produce emotionalbondingby either the mother orfather.
Even scholarswhoacknowledgecertain social aspectsofpregnancy
have likewise missed thepregnancycareworkthatcan be disaggregated

130. Geduldig, 417 U.S. at496 n.20. To the extentthattheCourtsuggestedotherwise
in a notorious footnotethatdistinguished “pregnantwomen” from “nonpregnant
persons,”id., that suggestionhasbeenalmost universallyreviled. See, e.g., JoannaL.
Grossman, Pregnancy, Work, andthePromiseof Equal Citizenship,98Geo.L.J. 567,599
n.171 (2010) (“[Geduldig] has been rightlylampooned for its reasoning,which is
essentiallythesameasholdingthatalawthatdiscriminates against bachelors doesnot

the FourteenthAmendment,91Harv. L. Rev. 1, 54 n.304(1977)(“[T]heconstitutional

phenomenon, [is a]goodcandidate[]forearly retirement.”); Law, supranote9,at983
(“Criticizing Geduldig has since becomea cottageindustry. Over two dozen law review
articleshave condemnedboththe Court’s approach and the result.”). Given that the
Court treated pregnancyas a purely physical condition unique to women, itslater
disentanglementofpregnancyfrom sex went entirelyunjustified.

pregnancy discriminationwas not sex discrimination for purposes of Title VII, carework
was likewise nowhere mentioned. See429 U.S. 125, 133–37 (1976)(consideringthesex-

Ginsburg havearguedthatthefocus onpregnancy as a physical experi-
ence is excessive.134 To these scholars,pregnancyisalsoamomentdefin-
ing thesocialrolesofexpectantmothers—butonlyexpectantmothers.
Becausepregnancy“isabiologicaldifference”135 that “women[]distinc-
tively”136 experience, itdefinessocialroles for women andnotformen.
The reasonisthat the socialimpact of pregnancy flows only from physical
factofgestation,notfromthecareworkthatpregnancy generates.137 For
these scholars, recognizingthesocial impactofpregnancyexpandsnot
the classof relevant stakeholdersinthepregnancybut the classof
relevant stakesthat expectant mothers—andexpectantmothers alone—
faceduring the pregnancy. So theonlyrolethatmenplayisascompa-

they generatefromothersaspregnancy—butmenexperience these
conditions only outside ofpregnancy.138

which womendoallofthework—whetherbiologicalornot.Robust
scholarly debatesaround these decisionshavemissed thisand havethus
only reinforced an inherently sexed conceptionof pregnancy. And even
if equalprotectionscrutiny were otherwise recognizedtoapplytopreg-
nancy, constitutionallaw might still prevent thisunder a reading ofrepro-
ductive rightsjurisprudencethatraisesconcernsabout any maleinvolve-
ment inpregnancy. In thewakeof this constitutionaltreatment,ahostof
faciallysex-discriminatory laws,includingthoseassigning workplace
rights, remaininthecontextofpregnancy, even thoughanalogouslaws
havelong been eradicated afterbirth.
1. ConstitutionalLaw. — Sex-equalitylaw—like so much of anti-
discriminationlaw—isdefinedbycomparisons.139 After birth,equal
protectioncasesexaminewhether federal and statelaws“presume[] .. .
[that]themotheristhe ‘center of homeandfamily life’”140 by comparing
what care- and market-work the law expectsof mothersand fathers.141
Beforebirth,though, equalprotectioncasesreflectandreinforce the
breadwinner–homemaker divide by not comparingthecapacityof
expectantmothersandexpectantfathers to engagein care- andmarket-
work.Courtsandcommentators across thejurisprudentialspectrum
agree that if there isanequalprotectionclaiminthecontextofpreg-
nancy, it is becauseof a comparisonbetweenapregnantwoman anda
man facing a similar physical complication, notbecauseof a comparison
between a pregnantwomanandanexpectant father.142
Consider,again,theCourt’sdecision in Geduldig v. Aiello.143 Counsel
for bothsides—aswell as the majorityanddissenting Justices—agreed
that the relevantcomparison forconstitutionalpurposeswould be bet-
ween pregnantwomenandsimilarlysituatedphysicallylimited employees
(both male and female).144 Theplaintiffs suggestedthattheonlymale
workers similarlysituatedtothepregnantplaintiffs were thoseatriskof

that theproblemwith Geduldig is thatithasauthorized “discrimination

postbirth period,antistereotyping advocates nevermentionedhowthe
lawwould enforce stereotypicalsexrolesbypresumingthatpregnancy
hadnocarework impact on expectantmen.153
Even lawsthatclassify on thebasisof sex but relatetopregnancyare
treated more deferentiallythanlawsthatmake other sex-basedclassifica-
tionsbecauseofthe assumption thatpregnancyisnecessarily sexed.In
contrastto the postbirthperiod,the Court unquestionablyacceptsavari-
etyof sex-specificconsequences beyond thephysical thatareseentoflow
inevitablyfromthebiologicaldifference ofpregnancy. For example,in
Michael M. v. SuperiorCourt, theCourtuphelda statutoryrapelawthat
only men couldviolate, on the basis of genderedphysical difference.154
The Courtjustifiedthelaw“bythe immutablephysiologicalfactthatitis
the femaleexclusively who can become pregnant.”155 Thesephysical
differences also generatedsocialconsequencesthatapplied uniquelyto
women:“Onlywomenmay becomepregnant,andtheysuffer dispropor-
tionatelythe profound physical, emotional,andpsychologicalconse-
quencesof sexual activity.”156
Constitutionallaw sexes pregnancy not just by failingto scrutinize
sexed lawundertheEqualProtection Clause but also by potentially
requiring that pregnancy be sexed because of constitutionalreproductive
rights. Typically,formalequalityundertheEqualProtectionClause
presentsnoindependentconstitutionalproblem.If a university
admissionspolicy isinvalidatedfordiscriminatingonthebasisofrace,
thereisnoconstitutionalproblem with arace-neutralremedy(unless
there is some remedial obligationtohavearace-consciousprogram).157
If menandwomenare treated similarly duringpregnancy, though,this
couldbe seen toundermine thewoman’s right tochoose whether to
carry the pregnancyto term. Fornowitisworth notingthatthesexed
pregnancyisoverlooked becauseofboththeabsenceof scrutiny and the
perceiveddemandsofaconstitutionalright.ThisArticleexplainsinlater
Partswhy these interpretations—acomplete absenceofheightened
scrutinyforpregnancy regulations and aconstitutionalmandate for a
universally sexedpregnancy—aremisguided.

2. Statutes andRegulations
a. Workplace Leave. — Postbirth-leaveprotectionsforproviding care
are almostentirelysex neutral.158 Women andmen are equallyable to
take time awayfromworktoattend important appointmentswiththe
pediatricianafterbirth.159 Women andmenareequallyableto use leaves
to findchildcareoncethey return to work.160
By contrast, prebirth-leaveprotections arechock-full of sex classifica-
tionsthat protectpregnantwomen’s carework but notanalogouscare-
workbyexpectantfathers. When it comestoprenatalleave,theFMLA is
facially sex discriminatory. FMLA regulations provide only “mother[s]”
with“FMLAleave...forprenatalcare.”161 The FMLA drafters men-
tioned“attendingappointments”and “obtaining essential knowledge
about how to care foranewborn”ascategories of “prenatal care”that
couldqualify for job-protected leave for only “expectant mothers”under
the FMLA.162 If anexpectantfatherwantsjob-protected leave to attend a
prenatal appointmenttoviewtheultrasoundandbondwith the child,
this is not coveredbytheFMLA.163
Expectant fatherscantakeprenatal FMLA leave, but only in a secondary
capacity, to “carefor”theexpectantmotherwhensheis“incapaci-
tated”or if such spousal supportis“neededtocare for her duringher
prenatal care.”164 After birth, theFMLA does not condition the father’s
ability topickupaprescriptionfor his childon the conditionofthe
mother.165 Beforebirth,theexpectantfathercanpickup a prescription
158. TheEqualProtection Clausewouldpresumably allow a leave policy for the
period of physicalrecovery from childbirth to be granted only to women whohavegiven
birth.Seesupranotes72,82–84 andaccompanyingtext(discussing how thedoctrine
permitsdistinctions based on these types of physicalsex differences).

for theexpectantmother only if sheis“incapacitated”andcannottravel
herself.166
Otherwise,expectantfathersareentitledtoFMLA leave onlytothe
same extent asanyothereligibleemployee. Typically, theFMLA requires
employees to have a “serious health condition”totake self-careleave.167
This would require an expectantfather to have “anillness,injury, impair-
ment, or physicalormentalcondition that involves...inpatientcarein a
hospital, hospice,orresidentialmedicalcare facility,” or “continuing
treatmentbyahealth care provider.”168 By contrast, the FMLA lowersthe
bar for pregnantwomen,whocan take leave for “[a]nyperiod of
incapacity duetopregnancy,” regardlessofwhetherherconditionis
“serious.”169 So apregnantwomanwho is experiencing antenataldepres-
sion due to worries about being amotherisentitledto FMLA leave if her
depressioncrossesthethresholdof“incapacity.” An expectantfatherwho
is suffering fromantenataldepression—whichresearchers estimate
happens toapproximately ten percentofexpectantfathers170—is not
entitledto leaveunlesshisdepressionreaches a higher bar.Likewise, a
father isentitledtotakeleave, includingto“provid[e]psychological
comfortandreassurance”tothepregnant mother if she is
incapacitated,171 but shecantakeleave to care for himonlywhen he has
a serious health condition.172

Still further, the FMLA providespregnancy-relatedbenefits to an
expectantfatheronlywhennecessary “to carefor a pregnant spouse.”173
This means that itisnotactuallytheexpectantfather whoisentitledto
any pregnancy-related leave under the FMLA but ratherthepregnant
woman’s husband, regardless of whetherthatpersonisthe expectant
parent. When thefatherofthechild is not married to the mother, he is
entitled to no pregnancy-specificFMLA leave eventhoughthe pregnant
woman is.The restrictionof leave tospouses issignificantnotonlyfor
denigrating the father’s role inthepregnancy but also for itspractical
consequences.Recentdatasuggestthatforty percent ofbirthsare to
unmarriedmothers.174 In thosesituations,mothersreceivetheirFMLA
benefits, andsinglefathersdonot receive eventheminimal benefits that
married fathers receive.
Becausetheselaws generally refer to “expectantmothers,” all
expectant fathers,includinggaymen who haveengaged a surrogate,will
be excluded,meaningthatnooneintheirfamilies will beeligibleforany
prenatal FMLA benefits. On the flipside,precisely because the laws refer
to “expectantmothers”175 rather than “pregnant women,” they mightbe
readtocover nonpregnantexpectantmothers,including lesbian
partners.TheFMLA’s limitation ofprenatalleaveto “expectant mothers”
also hasimplicationsfor transgender men. There is the rare but real phe-
nomenon ofthepregnantman.176 Female-to-maletransgenderpersons
can become pregnant.177 In somestates,apregnant man could be legally
male, rendering himineligibleforsex-basedpregnancybenefits like
those provided bytheFMLA.178 This requires a transgenderman to
choosebetween hisidentified gender and legal benefits.179

b. WorkplaceRights. — Workplace lawalsograntspregnantwomen
accommodationsandprotectionsagainstdiscriminationforcarework
they performduringthepregnancy while excluding expectant fathers in
similarcaregivingsituations. Manystates nowmandate reasonableworkplace
accommodations on the basisofpregnancy.180 These statelaws,
though, echotheFMLA’s prebirthexclusion of fathers by providing
workplace accommodationsonlytopregnantwomen.Forexample, New
Jersey requiresthatemployers “of anemployeewhoisa woman affected
by pregnancyshallmakeavailableto the employee reasonable accom-
modation in the workplace ...for needs related tothepregnancywhen
the employee,basedon the adviceofherphysician, requests the accom-

is entitledtooneunderthese laws, whileafatherwho needs the
same accommodationforantenataldepression or to attendaprenatal
appointment is not.
Expectant fatherscan also be punishedandeventerminated from
employmentforpregnancy-relatedcaregiving behaviors. TheFMLA
prohibits punishment orterminationofbothmothers andfathersfor
parenting behaviorafterbirth.182 By contrast,thePregnancy
DiscriminationAct (PDA), amending Title VII to protect againstpreg-
nancy discrimination, byitsown terms covers only “women.”183 This
assumesthatonlywomen face adverseconsequencesatworkduetopreg-
nancyandexcludesfathers fromprotection.Amanwhoattends a

terminated for attendingsuch an appointment, thismay give rise toan
inferenceofimpermissible pregnancydiscrimination.184 The PDA has
becomean increasingly litigated areaoffederal law, with more judicial
resources being funneled into developing abodyoflawthatprotects only
expectant mothers.185
If an employer generally allowed women but notmentoattend
prenatal appointments, a man might have aclaim for sex discrimination
under TitleVII. But therightthat the PDAgrants—tobetreatedthe

employersdefending onthegroundthat they granted the pregnant
woman leave only becausethey were legallymandatedtodo so under
eitherthe FMLA or thePDA,neitherofwhich extends itsprotectionsto
expectantfathers.
Notealsothe intersectionbetweenthefacialsexclassificationofthe
PDAand sexual orientationandtransgenderdiscrimination.Thesex-
discriminatory languageofthePDAmaypermit discrimination between
expectantfathers and lesbian expectant(butnonpregnant) mothers,
who arguablycould be coveredbythe term “womenaffected by preg-

the prebirthperiodinvolvescareworkthatcan be disaggregatedfrom
sex.
This Part makesthecase that carework in the pre- and postbirthcontextsareripe
forcomparison and should be treatedconsistently. It first
explainshowthetwocircumstancesare worthyof comparisonbecause
they bothshape a commonandcoreconcernofsex-equality law: the
sexed distributionsofcare- and market-work.Boththepregnancy and
the period immediatelyafterbirtharefoundationalmoments that shape
actual investments at home and in the market, as well as employers’
expectations oftheseinvestments.The failure tounsexpregnancytherefore
undermineslegalefforts tounsexparenting.Anditdoessobyits
effects not only on heterosexualcouplesbutalso on other parentingcon-
figurations.The sexed pregnancyprivileges different-sex oversame-sex
couples by denying many benefitswhen bothexpectantparentsaremale
and reinforcesnotionsofsexedcaregivingby how itdistributes benefits
to gay,lesbian, and transgender expectantparents.
This Part then discusseshowtheconcernaboutintrusion on
women’s bodily autonomydoesnot justifywhollydistincttreatment of
sexed carework in theprebirth period. Carework during pregnancy—
whether done by the womanortheman—oftendoesnotinvolvethe
woman’s body, and inthesecircumstancesitcan be appropriatelycom-
pared to careworkafterbirth.
A. Pregnancy as Parenting
Doctrinal differences withinsex-equalitylawbeforeandafterbirth
generate tension becausethesetwo areas ofdoctrine regulate similar
social realities. These two periodsdefine how sex operatesat the “fault-
linebetweenworkand family.”205 Laws regulatingpregnancy that pre-
sume thatthe“motheristhe ‘“center ofhomeand familylife”’”206 start in
motion “a...cycleofdiscrimination that force[s]womentocontinueto
assume theroleofprimaryfamilycaregiver,andfoster[s]employers’
stereotypicalviewsaboutwomen’s commitmenttoworkandtheirvalue as
employees.”207
Before proceeding further,itis importanttonote that thecompari-
son between thedoctrineofpregnancy and the doctrine of parenting is
anythingbutperfect.Duetomeaningfuldifferences between pre-and
postbirthcarework, thelawneed not treat“theallocationoffamily
duties”208 identicallybeforeandafter birth. The SupremeCourt has said
that “[p]hysicaldifferences betweenmenandwomen”are “enduring”

Whilethese physical differences mean thatlawsregulatingpreg-
nancy can be more sexed than thoseregulatingparenting after birth,it
does not render these areas oflawentirely distinct.The goalof sex-
equalitylaw is to—as the Courtputit in Hibbs—eliminate“thepervasive
sex-role stereotype thatcaringforfamilymembers is women’s work.”216
The lawof the sexedpregnancyencouragespregnantwomentomake
investmentsin caregiving duringthepregnancyanddiscourages
expectant fathers fromdoingsoina way thatpersistsafterbirth,regard-
lessofeffortstounsex afterbirth.Thelawofthesexedpregnancyalso
encouragesemployerstostereotype womenascommitted to care and
men as committedtocareerin a way thatpersistsafterbirth, regardless
of anyefforts tounsex after birth.
The Court in Hibbs recognizedthe foundationalimportanceofthe
momentsafterbirthfor developing caregivingidentities andattach-
ments.217 The momentsbeforebirthareequally important. Anentire
fieldof“prenatal attachment studies” has shownthatitisduringthe
pregnancy that expectantparents first startto love theirfuture child
“bothas an extension of self and as an independent object.”218 The
attachmentsgenerated—ornot generated—during the pregnancypre-
dict laterparental identityandinvolvement. If an expectantparent
approachesthepregnancywithout any change in self-conception or
socialrole, this predicts lesser involvementafter birth.219 If, ontheother
hand, anexpectantparentbeginsto think ofherselforhimself asapar-
ent duringthepregnancy,thatpredictsgreaterinvolvementafterbirth.220

expectant father,suchas attendingthefirstultrasound,selectingacrib, or
finding achildcare center, may be significantmotivatingexperiences.222
While cases like Hibbs identified the importance of unsexing care-
worktocombatstereotypes afterbirth,theseefforts areunderminedby a
sexed law of pregnancythatprovides pregnantwomenwithgreater
incentivesthanexpectantfatherstoinvestincareworkduring the preg-
nancy.223 Federal andstatelawsprotectpregnantwomen but not
expectantfathersfromriskingtheirjoborother work penalties fortend-
ing toprenatalmatters.224 Federal law reducesthecostof engagingin
prebirth careworkforpregnantwomenbutnotexpectantfathers.225
The absence of anymeaningful legal recognition ofthe idea thatthe
expectantfathershould engage inthepregnancyhasanevendeeper
and morepervasive cost. The idea that the expectantfathershould
participate substantially in the pregnancyisconsidered “off-the-wall.”226
Because such anideais nowherein law, it is(almost) nowhereinsocial
life either.227 This meansthatanexpectant fatherwhodoes participatein
thepregnancy canrisk severe stigma.228 So notonlydoesthelawfailto
disrupt this stigma, butitmight be heldresponsibleforit.
When laws dotrytoencouragefatherinvolvementduringthepreg-
nancy, theydosoinawaythatreflectsandreinforcestheseparate-
spheres mentality.TheFMLA, for instance,justifieslimitingmostprena-

Thesemechanismsof sex inequalityduringpregnancyhaveconse-
quencesformarket work.Becausepregnantwomeninvest relativelymore
in caregivingthanexpectantfathers from the beginning ofthepreg-

surprising, then, thatthemotherhoodpenaltywomenface at workstarts
to accumulate during thepregnancy, rather than after the birthofthe
child.247 The contrastwithmenis significant. Men start toworklonger

The sexed pregnancyundermineslegalefforts tounsexparenting
not onlyby its effects on heterosexual couples but also by its effects on
gay, lesbian, and transgender expectant parents. In Obergefell v. Hodges,
the SupremeCourt decidedthatitwas unconstitutionaltoprivilege
different-sexover same-sexcoupleswhenitcomestomany of the most
importantpartsofparenting.250 For instance,theCourtlisted“birth.. .
certificates[] . ..andchild custody, support, andvisitation”as“aspectsof
maritalstatus”that needed to be open equallyto different-and same-sex
parents.251 The constitutionalmandate to equalize different- andsame-
sex parents in the periodafter birth presumablyextends in substantial
part to the periodbefore birthas well.
The sexed pregnancy’s focusonthepregnantwomanastheholder
of benefitsandprotections violates this mandate. Sexed pregnancy
regulations excludeallgaymenexpectingchildren becauseof their sex.
So whereas the lawofthesexedpregnancy grantsprotections and benefits
tooneexpectantparent inheterosexualcouples, it affordsthese
same privilegestono one ingay-malecouples.Underthe sexed preg-
nancy, gay-male couplesareinadequate parents,notonly because of
their sexual orientation,but also becausetheir familyismissingan
appropriate caregiver—awoman.Thisreinforcestheconstitutionally
suspect stereotype that caringiswomen’s work, while also reinforcing the
constitutionallysuspect second-classstatusofsame-sexfamilies.252 And by
excludingthetransgenderpregnant man fromitsbenefits andprotec-
tions,thesexedpregnancy rejectsthe idea of men ascaregivers, even
when they aresituated in precisely thesame circumstanceaswomen.253

As for lesbian women, some of thelaws discussed apply onlytothe
pregnant womanherself,excluding nonpregnantexpectantwomenjust
liketheyexclude expectantfathers.Otherlaws,accordingto their lan-
guage, could be read to apply to nonpregnantexpectantwomen.254 To
theextent thatanyoftheselawscovernonpregnant expectantmothers
but not nonpregnantexpectantfathers,theytreatpersonsdifferently
solely onthebasisof sex, evenwhentheyaresimilarly situated. Inso
doing, they reinforce theconstitutionally infirmnotionthatcaringisa
woman’s domain.
B. Pregnancy andAutonomy
Another fundamental consideration is present before birththatis
not presentafterbirth:the sex-equality implicationsofreproductive
rights.255 While thisArticle’s earlier discussionsfocusedonhow sex equal-
ity can be undermined by too little parental involvementduringthepreg-
nancy, reproductive rightsjurisprudencehasfocusedonhow sex equality
can be undermined by too much involvement.256 Men’s involvementin
pregnancy so starklyraisesconcerns aboutinterferencewithwomen’s
autonomy, and thusequality,dueto one of thebasicfactsof pregnancy:
It occursin the woman’s body.257
Do thetwodifferent regulatoryregimes identified inthefirsttwo
Parts present a doctrinal distinction with a difference becauseofthis?
This section arguesthatcarework beforeandafterbirthcanbecom-
pared becausesexcan be disaggregatedfrompregnancy(like sex canbe
disaggregatedfromparenting).Disaggregating sexfrompregnancy
involves recognizingthe range of caregivingtasks that expectantfathers
can performthatdonotcompeltheexpectantmother to do anything at
all, let aloneanything relatedto her body.
Reproductive rights jurisprudencecancertainly be understoodto
meanthat deciding whether to carry a pregnancytoterm is thedefining
sex-equality considerationduringpregnancy.Becausegivingbirth
involvesa woman’s body, and because it definesherforthe rest of her
life,258 it couldraisesex-equalityconsiderationsdifferent fromthoseafter
birth. The SupremeCourthasindicated thatreproductive rights are
254. See,e.g., supranote187andaccompanying text (notingambiguity about
whether lawsthatgrantrightsto “expectant mothers” or “women affected bypregnancy”
wouldapplyin these situations).

particularly important rights forgender equality.259 If thewoman’s right
to chooseisatrumpcard during thepregnancyperiod,thenany sex-
equality benefits ofencouragingpaternalinvolvementinthepregnancy
must givewaytothewoman’s overridingreproductiverights.
Concededly,thisisaplausiblereading ofthedoctrine;itisnot,how-
ever, the best reading. Since Planned Parenthood ofSoutheastern Pennsylvania
v. Casey, the test forprotectingwomen’s reproductive autonomy has been
whetherthe government’s actions in purposeoreffect place an “undue
burden” on thewoman’s right tochoosewhethertocarryapregnancyto
term.260 This istrueregardless ofthelaw’sgoal.261 The “purpose”262 of
unsexing thesocialexperienceofpregnancyistobenefit pregnant
women by creating a more equaldistributionofcarework. The next
questionunder Casey is whether the “effect” ofthepolicy is substantially
burdensomeontheexpectantmother.263 Butthe primary reasonfor—
and likely effect of—unsexingthesocialexperience ofpregnancyisto
reduce the burden onpregnantwomen.264
In Casey and othercases, the Courthasalsoconsidered—evenmore
directly—whenthird-partyinvolvement inpregnancyinterferes with
reproductive rights.265 In Casey, theCourtconsideredtheconstitutional-
ity of a Pennsylvaniastatuteproviding that “except incases of medical
emergency, . . . no physicianshallperformanabortionon a married
woman withoutreceivingasignedstatementfromthewomanthatshe
has notifiedherspouse that sheisabouttoundergoanabortion.”266 The

Court invalidatedspousalnotificationbecauseitgavetheexpectant
father “dominion overhis wife.”267 Note that after Obergefell this concern
and theconstitutionalrightthatprotectsagainstsuch spousalcontrol
couldeventuallyextend to all spouses,regardlessof sex.268
Casey might be read todistinguishpaternalinvolvementinthepre-
and postbirth period because ofthe concernaboutbodily autonomy.
The Courtstatesthatifit were consideringalawthat
require[d] the mother to notifythe father before taking some
actionwith respect toalivingchildraised by both,...itwould

Before birth,however,theissuetakes on a verydifferent cast.It
is aninescapablebiologicalfactthatstateregulationwith
respecttothe child a womaniscarryingwillhavea far greater
impactonthemother’s libertythan on the father’s.269
A closer reading reveals thatthe concern the Court had about
paternalinvolvement in pregnancyisnotaboutpaternal involvementin
pregnancyperse.Indeed,theCourt suggests the importance of paternal
involvement evenduringthepregnancy.270 Not all paternalinvolvement
raises the same concernsasthespousal-notificationprovision in Casey.
The statutethere gave the expectantfather aright tocompel the
expectant mother todosomething—notify the husband of her

IV. UNSEXING PREGNANCY
The firstthreePartsofthisArticle identified a substantialtensionin
sex-equality law. Courts andcommentators have focusedsignificant atten-
tion on disaggregatingsexfromparentingbecause no physical sex differ-
encesdictatesex roles inparenting. But theyhavefailedtodo so during
pregnancy,eventhough there aremanyfacetsof gettingreadytoparent
during pregnancy that have nothingtodowithphysicalsex differences.
This Partconsiderswhat a doctrine unraveling this tension wouldlook
like. Italsoconsidershowsex-equalitylawcouldunsexpregnancyto
make thelawofpregnancy consistentwith the lawofparenting.This Part
focusesondoctrinal reconstruction,considering how existing sex-equal-
ity lawalreadyrelies onunsexingarguments and how thesejurisprudential
structurescanconstruct a sex-equalitylawthatunsexes pregnancy.
This Partfirstconsiders how sex-equality law can extend heightened
scrutinyfor sex classificationsto the pregnancyperiod.Caseslike
Geduldig v. Aiello273 do notclose the doctrinaldooronthis;rather,the
argumentis that caseslike Geduldig opened thedoortocloserscrutinyof
preciselythesortofinvidious discriminationinvolvedinsexingpreg-
nancy.ThisPartthenconsidershow unsexing pregnancycouldenhance
sex equality and autonomyrights—consistentwithreproductiverights
jurisprudence—ratherthanforcedoctrinetochoose between thetwo.
A. Scrutinizing Pregnancy
The doctrinaltensionthisArticlehasidentified in the lawofsex
equalityis a lack ofcomparable scrutiny of sex classifications regulating
parentinginthepre- andpostbirthperiods. Sex-equalitylawcouldinva-
lidate regulationsinthe pregnancy periodthatarebasedon“invidious”
sex stereotypesrelatedtoparenting,liketheonestruckdown in Weinberger
v. Wiesenfeld.274 An even-handedapplicationofequalprotectioninthe
273. 417U.S. 484(1974).

pre- andpostbirthperiodswould achieve thegoalsofunsexing parenting
by freeing both women and menfrom the “very stereotype thelaw
condemns.”275 Cases like Hibbs havealreadystartedtomoveequal
protection doctrinein this direction after birth.Caseslike Geduldig
should be read tomeannotthatpregnancydiscrimination cannot be sex
discriminationbutthat pregnancydiscrimination constitutes sex
discrimination only when founded on sex stereotypes.
1. Constructing Scrutiny. — Scrutinizingsexclassifications has resulted
in substantialprogress inundoing separate-spheres thinking regarding
women’s andmen’s roles inthefamilyandthemarket after a child is
born byriddingthe lawofsexclassifications that arenotbasedin
physical sex differences.Applyingheightened scrutiny tosexclassifica-
tions inthepregnancyperiodcould achieve thesamesuccess.Extending
scrutinyto the context of pregnancy wouldrequire courts todistinguish
betweenwhensexclassificationsconstitutionally regulate on the basis of
physical sex differences and when they unconstitutionallyregulate on the
basisofsex stereotypes. Thelawwouldconsider who is similarly situated
with regardtopregnancyinlightofthegoalsofthe regulation,
regardless ofsex.276 The questionwouldessentially be one ofmeans–ends
fit. The classificationwouldhavetobe “substantiallyrelated”tothe
physical difference.277 If the classificationwere extended beyond what is
needed to addressthe physical difference, itwould be “irrational”and
therefore an unconstitutionalsexstereotype.278
This doctrinalapproach isconsistent with postbirth jurisprudential
trendsthatscrutinize sex discriminationeveninthefaceofphysical
differences.Theunsexingprojectmade a big leapforwardwiththe
Court’s recognitionin United States v. Virginia that sex classificationscan
be unconstitutionalevenwhenbasedonvalidphysical differences.279
Beforethis,the equalprotectiontreatmentof sex classificationshad
been either–or: Iftherewere a physical difference relatedtothelaw,it
wouldjustify the classification;therewasnoneedto resort to a
275.J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 138(1991)(internal quotation marks

marked anew departure for constitutionalsex discriminationdoctrine”).

stereotyping analysis.280 In Virginia, eventhough physical differences
between thesexeswere relevant tothetrainingafforded by the Virginia
Military Institute,thisdidnotendthe matter. Instead, theJusticesstill
assessedwhetherthe sex classificationwasbasedinan “overbroadgener-
alization[].”281 So whereas “‘real’ differences [once]served asacheck on
the reach ofanti-stereotypingdoctrine,” after Virginia, the “antistereotypingdoctrineserves
asacheckonthestate’sregulationof‘real’
differences.”282
Hibbs extendedthis doctrinalinnovation to thecontextof a physical
sex difference thatarises out ofwomen’s capacity to become pregnant
and bearchildren.283 Even thoughthere are physicaldifferences between
the sexes whenitcomes to recovery fromchildbirth,theCourtstillcarefully
scrutinizedparental leavepoliciestoensure thatanysexclassifica-
tion was fullysupportedbythisdifference and not sex stereotypes.284
Unsexingpregnancy at the level ofconstitutionaldoctrinewould require
extending thisrecognitiontotheperiodofpregnancyitself:Lawsthat
classifyon the basisof sex might actually be basedinstereotypes rather
thanphysical differences betweenthesexes.
Although Hibbs marksprogresstoward recognizing heightened scrutiny
forsex stereotypes inthepresenceofphysicalsexdifferences, itdid
not goasfarasitshould—thatis,toapplysuchscrutinyduring the preg-
nancyitself.Somehave arguedto thecontrary—that Hibbs marks the first
time theCourthasrecognizedthatpregnancyregulations canviolate the
Equal ProtectionClause.285 ForProfessorSiegel, the Court’s recognition
in Hibbs that lawsgrantingmaternity leave beyond the periodofphysical
disability afterchildbirthwereconstitutionally suspect wasaninstance of
the Court treatingapregnancyregulationasunconstitutional sex
discrimination.286 But Hibbs did notaddresssexroles during pregnancy.
In assessing the constitutional status of sex-differentiatedpostbirthleave
policies (that is,maternity leave andpaternity leave), Hibbs applied the
already-establishedprinciplethatlawsmaynotprescribesexroles after a

childisborn when these rolesarenotjustifiedbyphysicalsexdiffer-
ences.287 This narrowerinterpretationof Hibbs is only strengthenedby
thefactthat,several yearsafter Hibbs, the Courtaffirmed a federalstatute
featuring sex-role stereotypes related to pregnancy.288
Importantly, too, approaching theEqualProtectionClause in the
manner advocated here is notforeclosed by Geduldig and is even sug-
gested byit.Courtsand scholars disagreeabouttheholdingof Geduldig.
Some have read thecasetocategoricallyexcludepregnancyclassifica-
tionsfromever being sexclassificationsthatwould be subject toheightenedscrutinyunderthe
Fourteenth Amendment.289 Others haveread
the case more narrowly,asleaving open thepossibility thatpregnancy
regulationscould be sexregulations that would receive heightened
scrutiny.290
The textof the opinion itselfmakesquiteclear that Geduldig held
only that thepregnancy regulationunderconsiderationthere was notan
impermissible sex classification,not that a pregnancy regulationcould
never be an impermissiblesexclassification.291 Moreover, Geduldig states
287. The factthatit appliedthis scrutinyfrom the moment ofbirth is no advanceover
Weinberger. See supra note 49 and accompanyingtext. And evenwhenitcametothe
period immediately following birth, the Court stoppedshort of its standardtreatment of
sex classifications.TheCourt suggestedthat medical evidenceshowingthatwomenon
averageneedfourtoeightweeks torecover from childbirthwouldjustify granting this
amountofleavetowomenasaclass,eventhough some women intheclasswouldnot
needthismuchleave.See Hibbs, 538 U.S.at731&n.4.Thisviolates theperfect proxy rule
since only some but notall women needevenfourweeks to recover from pregnancy.See
supra notes68–71andaccompanyingtext;see also Case, Very Stereotype, supranote68,at
1450 (“[V]irtuallyevery sex-respectingrulestruckdownbytheCourtinthelastquarter
centuryembodiedaproxy that wasoverwhelmingly,though not perfectly, accurate.”).
Given that administrative conveniencecannot justify sex discrimination, a policygranting
all women postbirthleavebased on the averageamountof recovery time women need
should failunderheightened scrutiny.See, e.g., Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677,
690–91(1973) (collectingcasesonthispointandholdingthatalawtreatingmenand
womendifferently “for the sole purpose of achievingadministrative convenience” must
fail).
288. SeeNguyen v. INS, 533 U.S.53,68(2001).There,theCourtupheldalawthat
treatedmothersandfathersdifferently with regard to conferringcitizenship ontheir
children born abroad because “recognition that at the momentofbirth... the mother’s
knowledgeof the child and the fact of parenthood havebeen established inaway not
guaranteedin the caseofthe unwed father . . . is not astereotype.” See id.
289. SeeNeilS.Siegel &RevaB. Siegel, Struck by Stereotype: Ruth Bader Ginsburgon
PregnancyDiscriminationasSexDiscrimination, in The Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg

upon ashowingofeconomicdependence.294 Frontiero was explicit about
extinguishing sex stereotypes that make up the homemaker–breadwinner
dichotomy, because“thesexcharacteristicfrequentlybearsnorela-
tion to abilityto performorcontributetosociety.”295 Therefore,when
Geduldig refers to“invidious discrimination”duringthepregnancythat

as wellasthe implicationsfor sex equalityandforequalityforgayand
lesbian parents—a criticalpartofunsexingparentingunder Obergefell.297
The first type of regulation—those not basedin any physical differences—
wouldbeimpermissible.For example, laws thatprovide support
only forpregnantwomentoattend newborn careclassescoveringdiaper-
ing,sleep, andthelikewouldbe automatically suspect.298 Unsexing preg-
nancy requires a doctrine far more skeptical of sex classificationsbased
in assumptionsthat expectantfatherscannotor will notprepare foror
bond withtheexpectedchildduring the course of thepregnancy.299
The second andthird types ofcases—those based in physicaldiffer-
ences—arehardertodistinguish.Asin Virginia and Hibbs, a physical
difference would notitself resolve the constitutionalityof a sex-based
pregnancy regulation.300 Courts wouldinstead considerwhethermen
and womenare“similarly situated” withregardto the regulation,regard-
less ofanyphysical sex differences.301 This wouldrequirecourtstocon-
sider thepurposeofthesex classification(whetheritissufficiently
“important”)and also whether the sex classificationactually serves that
purpose(whetheritis“substantiallyrelated” to achieving thepur-
pose).302 In practice,sexmustserve as a “perfectproxy”for the law’s
objective.303 If thesex classificationextends beyond what is needed to
achieve the law’saim,itwillbeanunconstitutional “overbroad gener-
alization”premised on sex stereotypes.304

Evenintheseinstances, the lawshouldclassify on the basis ofpreg-

through a different physical mechanismthan smoking by pregnant
women,theexclusionofmencannotbejustified.313 Some studies show
thatpaternal smoking has a substantialfetal impact buta lesser impact
than maternal smoking.314 Even then,thecomplete exclusionof
expectant fathersmay not bejustified.While“theEqualProtection
Clausedoes not require that a State mustchoose betweenattackingevery
aspect of a problemornotattackingtheproblematall,”315 the lesser
impactofpaternal smoking—andnotstereotypical views oftherelative
importanceofpregnantwomenandexpectantfathers—musthavebeen
the actual reasonforthe law’s relianceonsex.316
Biologicalsexdifferences duringthepregnancybecomestillless
persuasivejustificationsforsex classifications giventhat pregnancy

also at settingupparentalhabitsfor after thechild is born,whenphysical
sex differences areirrelevant.In the smoking cessationexample,
encouraging a pregnantwomanor an expectant fatherto quit smoking
during thepregnancymattersbothforits impactduring pregnancy and
foritsimpact ontheenvironmentin whichthechildisraised. An equal
protectiondoctrinethatdisaggregates sex from pregnancy would

this wayhas important implicationsnot only for heterosexual couplesbut

B. ProtectingAutonomyRights
If applying heightened scrutinyunderour rereadingof Geduldig rendersa
sex classificationduringpregnancyconstitutionally infirm, what is
the proper remedy? Theanswercouldhaveimportant implicationsfor
women’s autonomy, as we might worry that somesex-neutralremedies
could result inexcessive intrusionintothepregnancybythe
nonpregnantpartner, withilleffects on reproductivefreedom.Disaggre-
gating sex from pregnancymeans separating out thosepartsofthe
pregnancy that necessarilyinvolvethe woman’s body andthereforeher
autonomy rightsfromthosethatinvolvecareworkthatcan be unsexed.
For thosepartsofthepregnancythatcan be disaggregated, this section
arguesthat extending legal benefitstothosetowhom they were formerly
denied will tend to bethe better legalremedyformostof theseequal
protectionviolations. Involving nonpregnantpartnersinthecareworkof
pregnancy canactually promoterather thanundermine both women’s
equalityandautonomy.
When a statutethat“benefitsoneclass . ..and excludes another
from the benefit” isfoundtoviolatetheEqualProtectionClause,“[a]
court mayeither declare [the statute] a nullityand order thatitsbenefits
not extend to the class thatthelegislatureintendedtobenefit, oritmay
extend the coverageofthestatute to include thosewhoareaggrievedby
exclusion.”320 We can refer tothefirstofthese alternativesas“leveling
down”andthesecondofthesealternatives as“levelingup.”Although leg-

ordinarily “extension, ratherthannullification,is the propercourse.”322
This hasbeentrue in the sex discriminationcontext.323
Levelingup is particularly importantforachieving sex equality when
it comes to caregivingresponsibilities. The SupremeCourthas
explained,inthecontext of theFMLA, why itis criticalfor sex equalityto
grantnotonly a right of nondiscriminationonthe basisof sex but also
gender-neutral affirmativecaregiving benefits. Inaworldwherewomen
engagein far more caregiving than men,and where employer“practices
continuetoreinforcethestereotype of womenas caregivers,” a rule of
formalequalitythat allows fornocaregiving benefitsat all “would
excludefarmorewomenthanmenfrom the workplace.”324 Sex-neutral
affirmativecaregiving benefits “ensure thatfamily-care leave w[ill]no
longer be stigmatizedas an inordinatedrainontheworkplace caused by
female employees,and that employers [cannot]evadeleave obligations
simplybyhiringmen.”325 Sex-neutral affirmativecaregiving benefits are
also essential forcombattingthe“stereotype thatonlywomenareresponsible
forfamily caregiving,thereby reducingemployers’incentivesto
engageindiscriminationbybasing hiring and promotiondecisions on
stereotypes.”326
But willlevelinguppresent aproblemforwomen’s autonomy?This
Article arguesthattheproperlimits in place under Planned Parenthoodof
Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey327 will mitigateanysuchconcerns. As

gest auniversal harm of maleinvolvementin the pregnancy writ large.

wife iscarryingdoesnot permit theStatetoempowerhimwiththistrou-
bling degreeofauthorityoverhiswife.”329
Leveling uppregnancybenefitsneednotpresentthisconcern
becausepregnancycanbedisaggregatedfrom sex. Once we recognize
the different waysinwhichthe expectant fathercanparticipatein the
pregnancy,itbecomes clearerthatthesedifferent ways can have different
relationships tothemother’s body andthustoherautonomy.This
section distinguishesbetweenthosewaysinwhichparticipationwould
requiretheinvolvementofthemother’sbody and thoseinwhichit
would not.Expectantfathers’jointparticipation in the pregnancy, such
as when attendingaprenatalappointment, poses the greatestriskfor
infringingautonomy. In such circumstances,the pregnant woman’s con-
sent should be required beforetheexpectant fathercanplayanyrole.
The expectantfatherwould havenoconstitutional330 or otherlegalright
to attend.331 Prenatal benefits exercisedafterthepregnantwoman’s con-
sent canbedistinguishedfromthefather-involvementlawsthat courts
have invalidated.Theinvalidatedlaws required motherstoinvolvefathers
in thepregnancy, whereas the paternalinvolvementproposed here may
be exercised only ifthe mother agrees.332 With thislimit, sex-neutral
pregnancy benefits do not present the type of excessive coercionthat
concerned the Courtin Casey. This holds true regardless ofwhether the

person is female ormale.

Even if levelingupbenefits inthepregnancycontextdoesnotpre-

significantexpressive or materialharmstowomen’s autonomythatcould
come from leveling up.As for theexpressiveharm,onemightbecon-
cerned that any legal movement towardrecognizing fetalinterests—espe-
ciallyasindependentfromthepregnantwoman—willtendtolimit
women’s reproductiverights.333 But disaggregating sex from pregnancy
by providing sex-neutralpregnancybenefits is mostly not aboutthe
fetus—andcertainlynotabout providing anyrightsvis-à-visthefetus—
but aboutpreparingtoparentthechildafter birth.Expectant parents

Still,curing equal protectionviolationsby levelinguppregnancy

than separation.336 She arguedthatthosewithcaregivingresponsibil-
ities—disproportionately women—donotachieve freedom by being left
alone butarefarmore free—and thusfarmore equal—whentheyare
supported.337
Under thisview,freedomforcaregiversinevitably turns onconnec-
tion, notseparation—onsupport,notsolace. Rather thannecessarily
interfering with autonomy, participationinpregnancytosupportwomen
in performingthecaregiving tasksthatthey tend tobearalonecanbea
means towardgreaterfreedomandthusgreaterequality.Thelawshould
not ignore this but shouldinstead trytoensure thatcriticalrelationships
are constructive relationships.Ratherthanactingonlyas a barrier to
expectant fathersundulyinterfering in pregnancyinawaythatunder-
mines sexequality,as in Casey, lawcanplay a role in encouraging
expectantfathers (and nonpregnant expectant mothers)toparticipate
in pregnancyin a way thatpromotes sexequality.
Disaggregating sexfrompregnancymightbeviewedaspartof a long
lineoflaws that have garneredthe support ofliberalfeministsdespite
the factthattheylikely play intoawoman’s calculusabout whetherto
carry a pregnancyto term. Itwould seem strangetothinkoflawslikethe
(arguing thatlawandlegaltheory are pervasivelymarked by a view ofpeopleasseparate
rather than connected);seealso Michael J.Sandel, Liberalismandthe Limits ofJustice
133 (1982)(statingthatmost contemporary politicaltheory is groundedinthe viewthat
“whatseparates us isin some importantsense prior to what connectsus,” and thus “[w]e
are distinctindividualsfirst,and then we form relationships”).

could interferewithwomen’s autonomy,theCourthadlittleopportunity to consider the
positivewaysinwhichconnectionscanfoster autonomy. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 896 (“The
Constitution protects individuals, men andwomen alike,fromunjustified state
interference, evenwhenthatinterference isenactedintolawforthe benefit of their

that autonomyturns on connection.Onerecent decision considered a Texas abortion
regulation that would force the closureof a significant number of abortion clinicsin the
state, requiringsome women to travel asubstantialdistancetoobtainan abortion.See

struck downinpart based on the recognition that exercisingtherighttoanabortion

CONCLUSION
The SupremeCourt’s opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges recognizinga
constitutionalright to same-sexmarriageis replete with “end ofhistory”
rhetoric.347 Lawisonelongmarch in which“newinsightsandsocietal
understandings can reveal unjustified inequality within ourmostfunda-
mentalinstitutionsthatonce passedunnoticedandunchallenged.”348
The lawhasgraduallymovedfromconstrainingthesexes to liberating
them.Thisis particularly truewhenlawinterjects itself atthe“faultline
between workandfamily.”349 Women canbe workers and parents, and so
can men.
Except whenitcomestopregnancy.Federaland stategovernments
spendbillionsof dollars eachyear subsidizing women devoting them-
selves to careworkduring the pregnancy,andencouraging men nottodo
so.350 However farwewanttogoforward toward sex equality in the
future, we have to start further backatthepregnancy itselfinconsider-
ing when sex inequality begins.ThisArticle moves usbackwardinpre-
cisely this way tomovethelawforward in achievingitsgoalofsex
equality.
