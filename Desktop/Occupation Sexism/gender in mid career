 Summary This longitudinal study investigates whether the work environment in mid-career is
 comparable for men and women MBAs. No gender differences were found in early
 career. However by mid-career, women report less income, career satisfaction, and boss
 appreciation than men. Discrimination is also more prevalent for women.
 Introduction
 The 1970s was the decade when women, supported by civil rights legislation, entered business
 in increasing numbers. It was also the decade when men and women increasingly demonstrated
 their commitment to business careers by pursuing the MBA degree. In the early years, the
 outcomes for these men and women showed relative equality in some work-related variables.
 This was the period when the new MBAs explored their career options, and began to establish
 themselves. That cohort is now in their early forties and has moved into the mid-career stage,
 generally considered to cover ages 35-45. More specifically for MBA career paths, we consider
 10-15 years since receiving the MBA as mid-career. This longitudinal study will investigate
 if, in the United States, the work environment in mid-career is comparable for men and women
 MBAs.
 There are two opposing views on this question (see Northcraft and Gutek, 1993). The first
 view suggests that the work environment within which these women MBAs now work is less
 hostile and more gender blind than it was in their early career stage due to the large influx
 of women into managerial positions. These women no longer need to be trail-blazers in predomi-
 nantly male organizations. It has also been suggested that by mid-career these women have
 had the opportunity to demonstrate their competence and that, just like men, their track record
 will determine how they fare in the organization (Maccoby and Jacklin, 1974).
 The second view suggests that these women are still pioneers into the upper echelons of
 corporate America. EEO legislation demands comparable treatment at the hiring stage and
 in early career but becomes lax when it comes to the mid-career stage. Women further along
 in their careers face subtle barriers to advancement that diminish their work opportunities
 (Morrison, White and Van Velsor, 1987).

 Past research
 We were unable to locate any studies that specifically examine gender differences in mid-career
 for MBAs. The few studies that have examined the careers of MBAs focused on the early
 career stage from just post-MBA to 10 years out. The studies found little difference in starting
 salary (Devanna, 1984; Frieze, Olson and Good, 1990; Gordon and Strober, 1978; Wallace,
 1989). Strober (1982) and Wallace (1989) also found no significant gender differences in salary
 four or five years post-MBA. Studies which examined salaries of MBAs further out found
 men earning significantly more than women. Devanna (1984), Olson and Frieze (1987) and
 Schneer and Reitman (1990) studying MBA alumni 8 to 11, 1 to 11, and 7 to 12 years post-MBA,
 respectively, found statistically significant gender differences in income with men earning more
 than women. These studies all controlled for other factors affecting income, either by matching
 pairs of respondents or by using regression analysis. Although these studies did include data
 from some graduates more than 10 years post-MBA, the analyses presented do not distinguish
 between income effects of gender on early versus mid-career respondents. The one longitudinal
 study which reports on income every 5 years up to 20 years did not include women (Harrell
 and Alpert, 1989). One study that attempts to examine income patterns of both men and women
 MBAs was conducted by Cox and Harquail (1991). They found significantly smaller salary
 growth for the women than the men. However, the MBAs were not at mid-career with an
 average of 4 to 5 years post-MBA and the study was not longitudinal, relying on reported
 prior salaries to determine salary growth rates. Thus, there have been no longitudinal studies
 of MBAs that specifically focused on mid-career and included women.
 Income is only one element in assessing a supportive work environment. It tends to be the
 element most studied because our society is 'bottom line' oriented, and because it is a variable
 which can be measured fairly objectively. However, it is also useful to ascertain the perceptions
 of workers regarding their environment. A measurement of satisfaction with work presents
 a summary view of the environment. Although questions on satisfaction were included in most
 of the studies, very few reported on the results by gender. Strober (1982) found greater satisfaction
 for women MBAs versus men MBAs 4 years post-MBA after controlling for salary, being
 a mentor, and work hours. Schneer and Reitman (1990), controlling for salary, field, and having
 an employment gap also found greater career satisfaction for women than men 7 to 12 years
 post-MBA. Cox and Nkomo (1991) did not find a significant gender difference in career satisfac-
 tion in their study of black and white MBAs, controlling for age, job performance, years of
 experience, company size and rate of management vacancies. As this study combined two data
 sets, the exact number of years post-MBA is not clear although the average number of years
 of work experience was six. Cox and Harquail (1991) also found no gender differences in career
 satisfaction controlling for age, experience, starting salary, and line or staff position for MBAs
 4 to 5 years post-MBA.
 There are other environmental factors which indicate treatment at work. One of these is
 discrimination. Discrimination may be subtle and not always easy to ascertain. Studies of income
 differences are often used to make tentative statements about gender discrimination. Studies
 of workplace-related activities such as job assignments, mentor roles, and interviewing processes,
 and studies of sex role stereotypes also lead to inferences about discrimination. However, few
 studies have directly asked questions on perceived discrimination. Frieze et al. (1990) found
 that 52 per cent of the women MBAs and 17 per cent of the men MBAs that they surveyed
 in 1983 felt they had faced discrimination (some of this discrimination was not due to gender).
 In their study of MBA accountants (Olson and Frieze, 1986), discrimination was perceived
 by 40 per cent of the women and 20 per cent of the men. In a prior study of MBAs, Schneer

 and Reitman (1990) found that 30 per cent of the women and 3 per cent of the men felt they
 had faced gender discrimination. One other factor, which was suggested to the authors through
 in-depth interviews with women MBAs, is the appreciation of the boss for the work of the
 employee. We identified boss appreciation as one of the key themes determining whether women
 continue working after having children. None of the studies of MBAs of which we are aware
 have collected data on this exact issue. Wallace (1989) did ask respondents who had received
 their MBAs 5 years prior whether they felt they had supervisor support, and 93 per cent of
 the women and 85 per cent of the men said yes. As the sample size is small and the author
 does not report relevant statistics, it is unclear whether this difference is significant.
 In sum, past research has focused on early career income differentials in assessing the supporti-
 veness of the environment for MBAs. Few differences were found within the first 5 years after
 graduation but significant differences began to appear after 7 to 12 years. The few studies
 of MBAs that examined career satisfaction revealed women to have satisfaction levels equal
 to or greater than men in early career. However, the two studies that specifically inquired
 as to discrimination found women significantly more likely to feel that they had been subject
 to discrimination in their careers than men. In terms of boss appreciation, there is insufficient
 prior research on the subject.
 Present study
 The purpose of the present study is to examine the careers of MBAs to determine if the environ-
 ment at mid-career is comparable for men and women. Based on the income findings from
 the prior research, we hypothesize that the environment for women will not be as supportive
 as it is for men at mid-career. The equality that was encouraged by legislation in the early
 years of a career will not be maintained in later years as subtle barriers to advancement diminish
 women's opportunities (Morrison et al., 1987). Although the prior research that examined satis-
 faction suggests equal or greater satisfaction for women than men, this applies to the early
 career stage and may be due to lower initial expectations of women (Strober, 1982). By mid-
 career, however, we feel that many women will become disillusioned with their careers due
 to the barriers they face. They will find their work is not being supported by their bosses
 at an acceptable level and that they have been discriminated against due to their gender. This
 leads us to the following hypotheses:
 HI. The women MBAs will earn less income than the men.
 H2. The women MBAs will be less satisfied with their careers than the men.
 H3. The women MBAs will report their work is less appreciated by their bosses than the
 men.
 H4. The women MBAs will be more likely to report having faced discrimination in their
 careers than the men.
 The preliminary portion of the study was conducted in 1984 (Reitman, 1985) when a six-page
 survey was sent to 345 individuals who received their MBAs between the years 1976 and 1980
 from a large private northeastern university. The response rate was 69 per cent with 238 MBAs
 completing the survey. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to test for gender differences
 in income and career satisfaction controlling for other factors that have been found to have
 significant influence (i.e. employment gaps, experience, work hours). The findings concur with

 the past research that in the early career stage, from 4 to 8 years post-MBA, there is little
 or no difference in the income or career satisfaction of men and women MBAs.
 Method
 Respondents
 In 1990 a second six-page survey was sent to those MBAs who had responded to the first
 survey. The response rate to the second survey was 74 per cent. Of the 176 MBAs who completed
 both surveys, 55 per cent were women. The average age of the respondents was 41 years,
 with two-thirds between the age of 36 and 45. Seventy-two per cent of the respondents were
 married and 66 per cent had children. In terms of employment status, 86 per cent were working
 full-time, 6 per cent were working part-time, and 8 per cent were not employed. Employment
 status did differ significantly by sex (X2 = 9.5, p < 0.01) with only 79 per cent of the women
 working full-time as compared to 95 per cent of the men. Comparisons of key variables suggest
 that those who responded to the second survey are representative of the entire sample.
 Measures
 Both surveys included questions on career path including current income (yearly salary plus
 bonus), employment status, and employment gaps. Income was measured in 1984 and 1990
 as current yearly salary plus bonus. Perceived treatment at work was assessed via three measures
 - career satisfaction, discrimination, and boss appreciation. The career satisfaction measure
 was assessed in 1984 and 1990 on a 5-point Likert type scale averaging satisfaction with seven
 factors (salary, title, autonomy, responsibility, skill enhancement, skill use, and opportunity
 for advancement). The scale has demonstrated strong psychometric properties in prior studies
 (Schneer and Reitman, 1990) with internal consistency reliability estimated at a = 0.87. Discrimi-
 nation was measured in 1990 via responses to the question of whether the person was ever
 denied a position or promotion because of discrimination with response codes 'yes', 'not sure',
 and 'no'. Boss appreciation was added in the 1990 survey as a one-item question as to whether
 the individual felt his/her work was appreciated by the boss with response codes 'yes', 'to
 some extent', and 'no'. In addition, the importance of work was measured in the second survey
 by a single 5-point item concerning how significant the person feels work is in his/her total
 life. This question has been used in research on the meaning of work (MOW, 1987). Early
 career employment gaps were assessed in the 1984 survey by asking whether the respondents
 had ever had a period where they were not employed since receiving the MBA. Mid-career
 employment gaps were assessed in the 1990 survey by asking the same question but with the
 time frame set as the period between the two surveys. Demographic data was also collected
 concerning age, sex, marital status, children, and father's education.
 Statistical analyses
 In order to test the hypotheses, only those respondents who reported working full-time in
 both 1984 and 1990 were included in the analyses. This resulted in a sample size of 140 that
 was equally divided between men and women. This does eliminate the 21 per cent of the women
 and 5 per cent of the men who were not working full-time, but current employment is necessary
 for the purpose of comparing career factors (i.e. income, boss appreciation). There were several
 statistically significant gender differences in the demographic variables. Women were less likely

 than 'men to be married (57 per cent versus 83 per cent) or have children (53 per cent versus
 79 per cent). Women also were more likely than men to have fathers who graduated from
 college (49 per cent versus 27 per cent).
 Multiple regression was utilized to test the income hypothesis. This allowed us to examine
 gender differences associated specifically with mid-career income by statistically controlling
 for prior income. In addition, we controlled for other factors. The presence of an employment
 gap in mid-career was entered as a dummy variable in the model because it has been found
 in prior research to influence income (Olson and Frieze, 1989; Schneer and Reitman, 1990).
 Father's education was also included in the model as a proxy for socioeconomic status which
 has been found in prior research to influence income (Frieze et al., 1990; Pfeffer, 1977). The
 significance one places on work should also influence income as it affects one's willingness
 to work hard (Warr, 1982). We therefore have included in the model a specific measure of
 work significance.
 Multiple regression was also utilized to test the career satisfaction hypothesis. This allowed
 a test for gender differences in mid-career satisfaction controlling for early career satisfaction
 levels. Income was also included in the model as it has been found to influence career satisfaction
 in prior research (Schneer and Reitman, 1990). Chi-squares were utilized to test the discrimi-
 nation and boss appreciation hypotheses as the measures are discrete.
 Results
 Simple means, standard deviations and correlations between the variables in the study can
 be seen in Table 1. Table 2 presents separate means and frequencies for each of the variables
 for men and women. Statistical significance of one-tailed t-test or chi-square results are indicated.
 As can be seen, the incomes for men and women in 1984 were not significantly different. However,
 in 1990 the sex difference is statistically significant (t = 1.89, p < 0.05) with women earning
 over $10 000 (13 per cent) less than men. Satisfaction repeats this pattern, with no sex difference
 in 1984 but a statistically significant difference in 1990 (t = 2.15, p < 0.05). Women in 1990
 were less satisfied with their careers then men. These findings suggest support for HI and
 H2. The results of the multiple regression analyses will be discussed later. The two additional
 measures of treatment at work also reveal gender differences in 1990. Women were less likely
 to feel appreciated by their boss than men (X2 = 8.3, p < 0.05) and were more likely to
 report having been subject to discrimination (X2 = 25.9, p < 0.001). These findings support
 H3 and H4.
 Results from the multiple regression for mid-career income demonstrate additional support
 for HI (see Table 3). Gender continued to contribute to the regression analysis for income
 (F = 4.3, p < 0.05) even after controlling for employment gaps, father's education, work
 significance and prior salary. The regression coefficients reveal that being a woman results
 in approximately $8248 (9 per cent) less income than men. As expected, the regression coefficients
 also indicate a statistically significant relationship between 1990 income and prior income, work
 significance, and father's education. Only a mid-career employment gap is not significantly
 related to income.
 Results from the multiple regression for mid-career satisfaction demonstrate additional sup-
 port for H2 (see Table 4). Gender continued to contribute to the regression analysis for career
 satisfaction (F = 6.1, p < 0.05) even after controlling for prior career satisfaction and 1990
 income. The regression coefficients reveal that being a woman is associated with lower mid-career

 significantly contributes to the model.
 Discussion
 This study confirms that at mid-career, the work environment is less supportive of women
 MBAs than of men, whether one considers income or more subjective measures of treatment
 such as satisfaction, boss appreciation or discrimination. The hopes for a more egalitarian
 workplace generated by the early career experiences of these MBAs have not materialized.
 In terms of income, this supports the view that there are barriers to women's advancement

 in mid-career (Morrison et al., 1987). It is disappointing that more than a quarter of a century
 after Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination in compensation or conditions
 of employment due to sex, we do not find extended income equality. The Act seems to have
 had an impact predominantly on unfair hiring practices affecting the early career stage (Lublin,
 1991). The Civil Rights Act passed in November 1991, however, may cause businesses to rethink
 practices regarding promotion and discharge since it now allows punitive damages and jury
 trials in discrimination cases (Lublin, 1991). One positive element in this study, for both men
 and women, is that a gap in mid-career does not appear to have a significant negative impact
 on income. This is encouraging since we found gaps earlier in a career were damaging, especially
 for men (Schneer and Reitman, 1990). It is possible, however, that the small number of people
 in this study with a mid-career gap precluded a significant finding.
 The study found lower levels of satisfaction for women than for men in mid-career. A compari-
 son with satisfaction levels in early career shows that men have nearly the same levels but
 women's levels have declined. This finding supports the view that women face barriers to career
 advancement. Perhaps women's initial career expectations are lower than men's and thus women
 are more satisfied than men with initial career successes (Strober, 1982). Experience in organizaThis content downloaded from 128.2.149.6 on Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:37:52 UTC

 tions may raise expectations and when greater opportunities and rewards do not occur in mid-
 career, satisfaction diminishes. Women may also become disillusioned with the mores of organi-
 zations and the quality of life which results (Hardesty and Jacobs, 1986). After trying to fit
 the male organizational mold, sometimes with success, women may reconsider the desirability
 of that mold compared to other work patterns. It is interesting to note that, although women
 had lower career satisfaction than men, there was no gender difference for the importance
 of work in their lives.
 The results confirm a gender difference in perception of appreciation by the boss. Women
 were more likely than men to report that their work was unappreciated. The data on boss'
 gender, race, and age present possible explanations for this finding. For both men and women,
 the gender and race of the boss was overwhelmingly white male (85 per cent male, 98 per
 cent white). Research on evaluation bias has suggested that men appreciate men's work more
 than women's (Nieva and Gutek, 1980). It is also possible that men know how to express
 appreciation better to men than women. Another interesting finding is that women had signifi-
 cantly younger bosses than men (41 years to 45). Since the average age of the respondents
 was 41 years, perhaps bosses have difficulty working with older subordinates.
 The finding that women are more likely to report having faced discrimination than men
 is consistent with prior research. Additional insight into this question can be garnered from
 respondents' comments regarding discrimination. Three times as many comments were supplied
 by women than men (47 versus 15). The majority of the women's comments focused on gender
 discrimination. Age discrimination was the next most frequent response. For the most part
 the comments about sex discrimination reflect problems with promotions and equal treatment,
 and refer to them as 'facts of life'. They talk of the 'old boy network,' of being in a male-dominated
 industry or firm, of less qualified men being chosen for promotions. Several mention that discrimi-
 nation has become more subtle, harder to prove, but some say it is blatant. In general, they
 have not sued their organizations; they have tended to leave, or to wait. Since a number of
 women mentioned age discrimination, one wonders whether this is related to the problem of
 boss appreciation, since bosses may be more comfortable with younger subordinates. For men,
 about a quarter of their replies cite reverse discrimination, another quarter cite discrimination
 on age, religion, minority or immigrant status, and the rest cite other 'unfair' criteria. These
 comments certainly reflect a workplace environment that is difficult for a number of women
 and men.
 Overall, this study of MBAs at mid-career reveals a less supportive environment for women
 than for men. This study augments the prior research by specifically examining the mid-career
 stage. In addition, measures other than income are explored to assess comparability in work
 treatment: perceptions of career satisfaction, discrimination, and boss appreciation. With a
 more diverse workforce predicted for the future, these factors may prove very important. Some
 limitations of the study should also be mentioned. The relatively small size of the sample may
 make it difficult to capture all the relevant relationships. Two of the variables (boss appreciation
 and discrimination) record respondents' perceptions; these are important as perceptions but
 may not accurately reflect reality. In addition, the respondents are from one school in one
 region of the country and thus may not be representative of all MBAs. The sample is also
 fairly homogeneous as to race and therefore the gender findings might not apply to MBAs
 from varied racial backgrounds.
 This study indicates the need to investigate careers of MBAs longitudinally to track the
 relative success of men and women. It appears that barriers may still exist for women mid-career.
 Therefore organizations need to pay attention to their environments and make them supportive
 for all. This will be of special importance as the workforce becomes more diverse.
